## Testimonials

> Michael's worked with us on multiple projects as a fractional engineering leader and I couldn't recommend him more highly. He's excellent at working with non-technical stakeholders and junior engineers alike, he's a great engineer, and a deep appreciation for context permeates all the work he does. He's also a really nice guy and very easy to work with. You should work with Mike if you get the chance.

## Recent Client Projects

<div>

### ü•á Budget Proposal Approval System

**My role and work:** Collaborated with product leadership to refine and document a complex business logic tree request, shaking out many edge case concerns. Crafted the full-stack execution of this vision in Elixir and LiveView.  
**Product Impact:** Added a powerful feature to the client's budgeting product, allowing their customers to create custom rule-bound approval flows.

### üìä Revenue and Expense Interactive Charts

**My role and work:** Transformed custom chart concepts from the design team and executed them using the Highcharts charting library. Reworked internal data fetching modules to define new data shaping patterns and testing approaches.  
**Product Impact:** With the addition of expressive and interactive visuals, customers have a greater sense of where the money is going.

### üîí Third-party Integrations for a Security Dashboard Platform

**My role and work:** A security platform wanted to expand its integrations with popular vendors, including Zoom, Google, and Microsoft. I added OAuth authentication workflows and various platform API consumption to centralize a security vision for customer accounts.  
**Product Impact:** Increased customer value in understanding what tools housed insecure accounts. Provided direct guidance on improving security and keeping it secure over time.

### üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Ongoing Maintenance for HIPAA-compliant Healthcare Platform

**My role and work:** Took ownership of a platform (web and mobile apps) previously built by a separate development agency. Shepherded it through a down development cycle, addressing bugs and adding features as needed. Nothing too sexy but honest work using a spread of tech, including Elixir, GraphQL, and React Native.  
**Product Impact:** Maintained customer delivery of product during a major developer handoff. Provided confidence and relief to the non-technical founders who could rely on someone when problems arose.

### üõ†Ô∏è Ember.js to LiveView Conversion

**My role and work:** Augmented a development team building SMS communication software and took ownership of converting some historic corners of the app that were still using Ember.js to a modern LiveView implementation. Some of these pages were rich CSV import flows, and care had to be taken related to maintain speed and stability.  
**Product Impact:** By employing me as a consultant focused on technical debt, the full-time staff was able to focus on more involved and structural platform initiatives. By removing Ember.js, the build and delivery tech stack was greatly simplified.

### üéì Elixir Mentor to Java Converts

**My role and work:** Augmented a full-time team that recently embraced Elixir and was actively converting the entire platform from Java to Elixir. I joined a team and helped mentor Java developers to master functional programming and Phoenix LiveView patterns. I also owned threads of work related to Facebook Marketplace API integrations.  
**Product Impact:** The team greatly appreciated having Elixir-experienced people around for questions, feedback, and timely pull request code reviews.

## Examples of My Work

### Community

- [Elixir Book Club](https://elixirbookclub.github.io/website/) (group administrator) biweekly book club reading and discussing topics of Elixir and general programming.

### Blog Articles

- [Personal Elixir Code Aesthetics](https://mikezornek.com/posts/2024/9/elixir-code-aesthetic/)
- [Potential Consulting Client Questions](https://mikezornek.com/posts/2023/3/potential-consulting-client-questions/)

### Open Source

- [Flick](https://github.com/zorn/flick) is a simple Elixir / Phoenix LiveView app to help capture ranked votes. You can see this project in action at <https://rankedvote.app/>. This project was built to help the [Elixir Book Club](https://elixirbookclub.github.io/website/) pick books but is open for all to use.
- [Franklin](https://github.com/zorn/franklin) was an intentionally over-engineered blog application written in Elixir. It was a project I worked on to get more familiar with event sourcing using [Commanded](https://github.com/commanded/commanded). While I am anxious to use event sourcing in the future, this project did not ship and remains an abandoned historic tinker space.
