I make a living through a combination of personal projects and consulting. As a senior developer I can help you mature your team's coding practices, design and prototype new web applications or improve customer experiences through deep, developer-aware quality assurance reviews.

[Let's chat](mailto:zorn@zornlabs.com) and work on something together!

## Services

### Elixir / Phoenix Mentoring and Development

I've been working with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) and [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org) since 2017 and find them both incredibly enjoyable and productive tools. In addition to my own side projects, I have helped small startups as well as larger corporate companies get the most out of Elixir.

One of the best roles for me is to join your team and help support full time employees through code review and mentorship while filling in the gaps with dedicated coding work. 

I can personally execute smaller projects by myself or help assemble a small dedicated teams for more complex endeavors.

<blockquote class="testimonial" cite="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikezornek/">
"Mike and I worked together at STRATIS in 2019/2020 where he helped my team gain momentum on our iOS SDK which is written in Swift.  Mike is an extremely thoughtful and thorough developer, and makes his experience obvious immediately by emphasizing proper unit testing and documentation. The domain at STRATIS is very deep, and often takes newcomers time to completely understand and become productive.  Mike was able to become productive in a very short period of time and was making good suggestions about the project from day one.  I would highly recommend Mike to any team in need of an experienced iOS developer and stellar software engineer."

## Rate

My rate is around $200/hr depending on the project complexities and other perks like prepayment/extended-timeline.

I invoice every 2 weeks with 15 days NET. When dedicating my attention to a full time engagement that usually means 32 hours per week with some allowances for timely incidents or downtime issues.

I consult under the company name **Zorn Labs LLC** and checks should be made payable to that name.
