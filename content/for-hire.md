I make a living through a combination of personal projects and consulting. 

[Let's chat](mailto:zorn@zornlabs.com) and work on something together!

**Update:** [Early 2023 Consulting Availability](/posts/2022/12/elixir-consulting-availability/)

## Services

### Elixir / Phoenix: Mentoring and Development

I've been working with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) and [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org) since 2017. Programming in general since the mid-90s.

As a senior developer I can help augment your team with a particular set of skills, including:

* Mentoring junior developers (or those new to Elixir).
* Helping the product team define features, identify edge cases, and break down work.
* Support the development team with project documentation improvement goals.
* Integrate with the design team as their developer advocate, helping transform idealized mockups into a component-based design system crafted for LiveView specifics.
* Assist the QA team in identifying and resolving bugs. I am particularly good at breaking software.

Working on open-source projects and tools is a notable plus.

"Mike and I worked together at STRATIS in 2019/2020 where he helped my team gain momentum on our iOS SDK which is written in Swift. Mike is an extremely thoughtful and thorough developer, and makes his experience obvious immediately by emphasizing proper unit testing and documentation. The domain at STRATIS is very deep, and often takes newcomers time to completely understand and become productive. Mike was able to become productive in a very short period of time and was making good suggestions about the project from day one. I would highly recommend Mike to any team in need of an experienced iOS developer and stellar software engineer."
