## OwlDeck

The OwlDeck project was to build a new macOS presentation tool geared towards programmers and geeks who need to display code and love Markdown.

I worked on OwlDeck for a few months but inevitably ran into too many headaches with the low level text system of macOS and felt the project unmaintainable. I did learn a lot through the process, including writing my own Markdown parser in Swift which was a plus.

To see some of the early builds in action, check out the development journal videos:
