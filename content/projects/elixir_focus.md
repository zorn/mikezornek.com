# Elixir Focus / Phoenix by Example

For a while I was considering getting into the paid-for educational content space, targeting Elixir developers. I started with a site called Phoenix by Example, but then migrated it to a new name of Elixir Focus.

I blogged, build some demo projects and did some talks.

Ultimately I decided the market was not big enough for the financial goals I had in mind and while I still would blog and teach from my own Elixir experiences that would be in a more casual and not a for-profit endeavour. 

The sites will be closed down soon and any previous work migrated to my personal spaces here and on GitHub.
