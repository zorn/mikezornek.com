# Franklin

Franklin was a project written in Elixir, Phoenix, and LiveView. It was an intentionally over-engineered blog application, an opportunity for me to play around and learn how to build software in an event-sourced / CQRS model using [Commanded](https://github.com/commanded/commanded).

I tinkered with a the project over a very part-time basis during summer of 2022 through spring 2023 but in the end decided to move on to new ideas.

I explained in [this blog post](https://mikezornek.com/posts/2023/5/side-project-launch-cold-feet/), that I had launch cold feet since there was a notable complexity to launching it (and migrating all my Hugo content) and I just wasn't up for it. There was not enough benefit to justify the cost/time.

The Franklin [repo](https://github.com/zorn/franklin) and [project board](https://github.com/users/zorn/projects/1/views/5) are still on GitHub (though marked as archived).

The documentation page is also still up. Specifically I'm proud of the [Testing in Franklin](https://zorn.github.io/franklin/testing.html) article (I suspect I'll migrate that to my next project) as well as the idea of building our [a decision document list](https://zorn.github.io/franklin/about.html).
