Guildflow combined my love of meetup groups with the aspirations of the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb).

After a little more than two years I decided to shut the project down, which was detailed in [this blog post](/posts/2021/10/guildflow-shutdown/).

Guildflow empowers meetup organizers to create a modern group website that respects the data and privacy rights of its members.

Using Guildflow groups:

* have more control of their data enabling true data portability
* run a website using their own domain
* can offer more fine grained privacy options for its members

**Related Tech:** Elixir, Phoenix, Ecto, GraphQL, iOS, Android, HTML5, CSS, Multi-tenant Databases.
