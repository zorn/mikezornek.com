# Mike Zornek (Personal Website)

My personal site is far from a complex project, but it is an example of me and my work.

The site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) a static website generator with a custom theme handcrafted by myself. The code is open source and [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/zorn/mikezornek.com). Changes to `master` result in an automated publishing script ran by [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) with the final contents published to [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) which hosts the website using a simple [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) VM node.

The setup is not too dissimilar to the work I did for the [Philly CocoaHead's website](/projects/philly-cocoaheads/) (though they are hosted using Amazon instead of Linode.)

**Related Tech:** Hugo, HTML/CSS, GitHub, CircleCI, Linode, Apache
