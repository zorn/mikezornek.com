## Agency Projects

While a full time employee at a pair of large agencies I had the opportunity to work on many iOS projects. However, because of NDA clauses I can not reveal actual clients. Instead I'll describe the projects in more generic terms:

- **iPad Roofing Preview App** - would let people take a photo of their house, choose roofing tile and preview what it would look like and cost.
- **iPhone Bluetooth Tool Tracker** - Would use the phone to help locate power tools and batteries. Would also report battery charge levels and heat warnings.
- **iPhone/iPad workout app** - a universal iOS app that helped people execute and customize a 7 minute workout routine.
- **iPhone/iPad doctor/patient diabetes app** - a collection of iOS and Android apps that would allow doctor's and patients to share and visualize data about the patient's diabetes and potential medications.
