## MegaManEffect

My first "real" MacOS app. Based on the Nintendo game MegaMan 2, the MegaManEffect would play a fun animation as you launched apps on Mac OS X. I wrote the app at MacHack (getting 2nd place in the hack contest) and then a year later it blew up on the internet, even getting featured on Attack of the Show.

It remains a very sloppy open source project here: <https://github.com/zorn/MegaManEffect>
