# Elixir Club

ElixirClub was an outcome-oriented community website that hoped to help Elixir developers finish their side projects. I kicked off the project in December of 2022 and ran it for a few months but did not get the traction I needed and decided to shut down the site about six months later.

You can check out this kickoff video for a sense of what I was trying to build.

As I shared in my [shut down announcement blog post](http://localhost:1313/posts/2023/7/shutting-down-elixir-club/):

> I ran the site on Circle, hosted some weekly events and async project update threads â€“ but the hard truth is that I was not able to create even the modest-sized community that I was aiming for.
> 
> There are reasons and lessons to be learned about pricing, pitches and what not. Ultimately it was very niche target and did not have a strong marketing angle.
