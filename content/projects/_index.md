# Active Personal Projects

## Course Dreamers

[Course Dreamers](https://coursedreamers.com) is a new blog where I share my research, observations, and links regarding the work of programmers and technically-minded folks building online courses, some for the first time.

I have aspirations of building some products / open source software for folks in this arena and am trying to spend some time to get closer to individuals on the ground. It's still early days but sharing what I find on the new site.

## Mike Zornek.com

This very website is an open source project using tech including: Hugo, HTML/CSS, GitHub, CircleCI, Linode and Apache. [Background](/projects/mikezornek-site/)
