# Active Personal Projects

## StudyHall

[StudyHall](https://github.com/studyhall-project/studyhall) is an open-source courseware platform that (aspires -- it's very early) to help people publish and consume courses focused on improving programming and technical skills. 

The early user experience will lean towards maximizing student success through tooling that:

* helps teachers understand student goals and progress
* provides streamlined communication tools to ask for and provide help
* allows students to provide content feedback to help improve courses over time

## Course Dreamers

[Course Dreamers](https://coursedreamers.com) is a new blog where I share my research, observations, and links regarding the work of programmers and technically-minded folks building online courses, some for the first time.

I have aspirations of building some products / open source software for folks in this arena and am trying to spend some time to get closer to individuals on the ground. It's still early days but sharing what I find on the new site.

## Mike Zornek.com
