# Active Personal Projects

## Franklin Blog Engine

Right now, this site is built using Hugo. I have aspirations of doing something more complex and so as an experiment I've started building a new blog engine. It is primarly a place for me to experiment with some CQRS / event-sourcing patterns and is still very early on. If you want to learn more check out my [Side Project Idea Audit](https://mikezornek.com/posts/2022/6/side-project-idea-audit/) blog post or the [repo](https://github.com/zorn/franklin) and [project](https://github.com/users/zorn/projects/1/views/1) directly.

## [ElixirClub](https://mikezornek.com/posts/2022/11/elixir-club-intro/)

ElixirClub is an outcome-oriented community that helps Elixir developers finish their side projects.

## [DockYard Academy](https://github.com/DockYard-Academy/beta_curriculum/)

DockYard is a large Elixir agency and they are building a bootcamp to help train first time programmers in Elixir. I try to stop by classes once in a while to help be a teacher assistant.

A monthly meetup group to talk about Elixir and Erlang things. We meet on the 2nd Wednesday of the month, online. It's a small, friendly group. Stop by and say hi!
