# Active Personal Projects

## Elixir Exercism Videos

[Exercism](https://exercism.org) is a website that helps people learn different programming languages through a series of coding exercises. They have a great [Elixir track](https://exercism.org/tracks/elixir) and I've been recoding myself working through it.

## Franklin Blog Engine

Right now, this site is built using Hugo. I have aspirations of doing something more complex and so as an experiment I've started building a new blog engine. It is primarly a place for me to experiment with some CQRS / event-sourcing patterns and is still very early on. If you want to learn more check out my [Side Project Idea Audit](https://mikezornek.com/posts/2022/6/side-project-idea-audit/) blog post or the [repo](https://github.com/zorn/franklin) and [project](https://github.com/users/zorn/projects/1/views/1) directly.

## [DockYard Academy](https://github.com/DockYard-Academy/beta_curriculum/)

DockYard is a large Elixir agency and they are building a bootcamp to help train first time programmers in Elixir. Their Livebook based curriculum is open source and I've been contribute as a technical reviewer on a part-time basis.

## [ElixirFocus](https://elixirfocus.com)

ElixirFocus provides educational content for Elixir developers looking to improve their coding skills.

This project is kind of on hiatus. I feel like I'm going to start just sharing Elixir content here on my personal site but things are still up in the air.
