# Active Personal Projects

## Franklin Blog Engine

Franklin is written in Elixir, Phoenix, and LiveView and is an intentionally over-engineered blog application (a future replacement for this Hugo-powered blog). It uses an event-sourced / CQRS core (via [Commanded](https://github.com/commanded/commanded)) alongside a modern component-based UI presentation. It aims to make even the simple things overly complex in the spirit of personal education toward these architecture decisions.

Franklin is on GitHub via a [public code repo](https://github.com/zorn/franklin) and [project board](https://github.com/users/zorn/projects/1/views/5).

## [ElixirClub](https://www.elixirclub.org)

ElixirClub is an outcome-oriented community that helps Elixir developers finish their side projects.

## [Elixir Book Club](https://elixirbookclub.com/)

We meet every two weeks and talk about our current book. I've been an active member for a few books where we've covered: Testing Elixir, Metaprogramming Elixir, Programming Phoenix LiveView, and Elixir in Action, Second Edition.

## [DockYard Academy](https://github.com/DockYard-Academy/beta_curriculum/)

DockYard is a large Elixir agency and they are building a bootcamp to help train first time programmers in Elixir. I try to stop by classes once in a while to help be a teacher assistant.

## [Philly Elixir Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PhillyElixir)

A monthly social meetup group to talk about Elixir and Erlang things. We meet on the 2nd Wednesday of the month, online. It's a small, friendly group. Stop by and say hi!
