## Dex

Dex was my first real app for iOS. It was a Pokemon reference tool that showed weaknesses, strengths, and stats. Sadly it was taken down from the store at Nintendo legal's request. It was a huge success though (~1 million downloads) and was the source of my talk on [iOS Monetization](https://vimeo.com/28678889).
