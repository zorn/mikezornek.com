## GEO

GEO was a team project from around 2010 that came out of an experimental entrepreneurial group at IndyHall. The basic idea is that GEO was an iOS game that would track your location and encourage you to walk around your neighborhood for exercise. As youÂ walked around you'd fight monsters, level up and find treasure. The idea was [ahead of it's time](https://pokemongolive.com/en/) but it never really gained any traction in our simple execution.

I don't seem to have footage of the final build but this preview will give you an idea of where we were headed:
