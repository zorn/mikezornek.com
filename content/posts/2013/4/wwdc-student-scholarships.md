Regardless to the near instant sell out of WWDC 2013, if you are a student their is still hope! Apple runs a [student scholarship program][1] and the deadline this year is May 2nd. I attended my first WWDC on a student scholarship and met some great people.

If you can go, I highly recommend applying. Good luck.
