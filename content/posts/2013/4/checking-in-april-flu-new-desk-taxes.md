Sorry for the lack of updates. I kind of fell into a work drought over last few weeks with a mixture of a bad stomach bug, a new desk which required lots of teardown of my office and now a few days of tax paperwork. Oh how I loath the tax paperwork.

On the fun side of things, I got to play through the campaign of Starcraft 2 and have been practicing my Protoss skills in some vs AI and ladder. I also picked up a 3DS XL (previously had a normal-sized 3DS) and have been revisiting some older games, playing Super Mario Land 3D and a few others. I also picked up Bioshock: Infinite but sadly due to the state of my room haven&#8217;t hooked back up the Xbox 360. Finally I&#8217;m playing [Link to the Past on YouTube][1] as a new Let&#8217;s Play. Been pretty good about posting new episodes daily. Feel free to check it out.

Will be back soon with some updates to my CB Reader project and others. Until then&#8230; ðŸ™‚
