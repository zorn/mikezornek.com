I finally got some time to play with Panic&#8217;s new [Status Board][1] today and I have to say it&#8217;s pretty cool.

![My Status Board Setup][2]

Status Board is an iPad app that helps you produce a visually pleasing status board to keep track of things in your life. There are built-in tools for email, twitter, weather and more. The real power though comes from the free-from widgets that let you build your own data sources.

In my own first draft status board I&#8217;m using one such custom source called [MintStatusBoardHelper][3], which is a [Mint][4] Pepper that will produce Status Board friendly JSON to help visualize website stats, in my case per-week visit counts. (Note: there was a little bug in this particular per-week source but it was easy enough to fix in PHP. I sent a report to the author as well so hopefully it&#8217;ll be gone soon.)

I was particularly happy to see that Status Board only required iOS 5. For me (and I assume others) this means we finally have a good use for those iPad 1s that sadly can&#8217;t run iOS 6 and have been collecting dust.

To stand it up I purchased a [portable fold-up iPad stand][5] on Amazon for ~ $8. The stand works well though you&#8217;ll have to plug the iPad in on the top as there isn&#8217;t enough room on the bottom. If you keep the iPad plugged in (to a full power outlet) and set the auto lock to never, the iPad basically becomes an always on screen.

Some things I&#8217;d love to see in the future:

- More boards, swipe left and right to switch.
- Font size options. My poor eyes can&#8217;t read the tweets.
- Render single and sequences of photos. Think digital picture frame.

I was always jealous of Panic&#8217;s [old HTML/TV-based status board][6] and now I have my own. So happy! ðŸ™‚
