Publishing to this blog is something I enjoy, but sadly not something I&#8217;m naturally good at doing on a regular basis. Forgive me Internets, it has been three months since my last confession, err blog post.

So what&#8217;s been going on? Well, October and early November were a mix of client work and [Shindig][1] development, a continuation of a year&#8217;s worth of very long, hard development hours for me. This sadly led to a bit of burnout. I felt it coming, so I was honest with my Shindig co-founders and arranged to take some leave.

This isn&#8217;t the first time that I&#8217;ve worked to excess and gotten burned out. Unfortunately, I&#8217;m someone who often lives in extremes, working super hard for a period of time and then not working at all for a period of time. It&#8217;s no good and I&#8217;m trying to mend my ways.

With my time off after Thanksgiving and into December, I got to catch up with my family, including my mom, who had recently retired. (She was even good enough to re-watch the Lord of the Rings trilogy with me in preparation for the Hobbit release). During this time, I also got sick and then got better. I caught up on some fun movies (Wreck-It Ralph, Sykfall, Hobbit, etc.), and got to check out the latest Warcraft expansion.

Alas, one can not stay cooped up forever, and now I&#8217;m working again at [IndyHall][2]. I&#8217;m trying to balance things better this time, going to hall 2-3 days a week and not overcommitting to projects. It&#8217;s been a slow start, but things are picking up a bit. I have a small contract that is under NDA but that is giving me the opportunity to learn some new and interesting tech (Ember.js, PostgreSQL, CoffeScript). I&#8217;m also doing a mix of marketing and product development with Shindig. Finally, I&#8217;m working to take care of some old personal projects and plan a few new ones.

All in all, things are good and I hope to be posting more soon. As always, thanks for your interest, and best of luck to all in 2013! ðŸ™‚
