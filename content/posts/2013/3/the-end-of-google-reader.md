Alas, as the [prophecies foretold][1], Google Reader will be [shutting down July 1st][2] and with it hundreds if not thousands of apps that used Google Reader as their centralized RSS hub will be in trouble.

Many of us saw this coming. I know personally, the previous lack of commitment from Google to improving Reader was one of many things that pushed me to start working on my own [CB Reader][3] system.

While in the short term this will be frustrating for many, the long term benefits will outweigh. This is good news.
