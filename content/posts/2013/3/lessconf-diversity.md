I read [the following LessEverything blog post][1] and tweeted:

> Maybe the irony is lost on me but this reads like pretentious bullshit.

@stevenbristol askes:

> it&#8217;s not at all meant to be. Can you tell me how?

Sure. Let&#8217;s tale a look&#8230;

> You Are Welcome at LessConf, Please Come

The title is nice enough, grats on that one.

> Considering this is the last LessConf and what a unique event it is, I&#8217;d like to send a special invitation to people not of &#8220;privilege&#8221; to attend.

I wonder what he means by &#8220;people not of &#8216;privilege'&#8221;? Like money? People who can&#8217;t afford to attend conferences?

> Allan and I are certainly irreverent, sometimes crass, but we always try to included everyone.

_irreverent_ (adjective): showing a lack of respect for people or things that are generally taken seriously

_crass_ (adjective): lacking sensitivity, refinement, or intelligence

Yeah, I can see that.

And by &#8220;include everyone&#8221; of course he is referring to his conference that has people apply and only after deeming them worthy are they given the privilege of buying a ticket.

> That&#8217;s how we&#8217;ve always been: You know the person at the office who is a bit weird or shy and no one ever invites to lunch? I always invite that person along for lunch. That&#8217;s just the kind of people we are.

Ok so now you are defining &#8220;people not of &#8216;privilege'&#8221; as people who aren&#8217;t social at work or deemed by you as &#8220;weird&#8221;. Seems off to me but moving on&#8230;

> LessConf, like most conferences, is filled with white heterosexual men, &#8220;people of privilege.&#8221; And that&#8217;s great, except that it&#8217;s also not great.

Ah so people of privilege are &#8220;white heterosexual men&#8221; and you seem torn if this is great or not so great. I wonder what he means by all this. I hope he explains. (Spoiler: He doesn&#8217;t.)

> We would like to extend a special invitation to persons who are not white heterosexual men to join us.

I&#8217;m no English major but doesn&#8217;t that statement mean the invitation is still reserved for heterosexual men of the non-white denomination?

More to the point, using a phrase like &#8220;not white heterosexual men&#8221; to group the &#8220;diversity&#8221; you are looking to bring into a conference community is pretty tasteless in my opinion.

> LessConf should be a place where all people feel free to be themselves; where everyone is loved and accepted and safe.

And appreciated gratuitous use of the word &#8220;and&#8221;.

> I don&#8217;t care who you are or where you fit in, I would like you to fit in at LessConf. Here&#8217;s a coupon for $100 off the price of the ticket. LessConfLovesMeTheWayIAm

If adding diversity to your conference was a real goal you wouldn&#8217;t announce it mere weeks before it opened. The whole thing smells like you haven&#8217;t sold out and are trying to use the &#8220;diversity&#8221; angle to sell more tickets, and very poorly at that.

Best I can tell this conference is something you hand made, picking the speakers, picking the attendees. If it&#8217;s not diverse you have no one to blame but yourselves.

Here&#8217;s an idea if you really want a diverse conference get people of diverse backgrounds to be on the planning committee. Let them attract a diverse speaker roster. Let the diverse speaker roster help attract a diverse audience.

Maybe Steven and company do want a diverse conference but I have to say making moves this late in the game with the above post is a pretty poor attempt.
