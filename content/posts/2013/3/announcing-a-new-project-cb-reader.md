Ah, the first public breath of a new project. So much potential and so much to do. Exciting times are afoot.

From [the teaser page][1]:

> CB Reader (code name) is a new project that aims to help people **centralize** their many sources of incoming online articles and **organize** them through semantic analysis and social network influence.

This is an application / service for people who use RSS, &#8220;read later&#8221; tools, Twitter and other sources to manage and read online articles. The big goal is to help you get the most from your limited reading time.

The only real action for you at the moment is to [sign up for the mailing list][2], should this type of app interest you. From here I will be inviting people to participate in various reviews and beta testing.

I&#8217;m going to be doing my best to blog progress at it happens. How this will break down:

  * [Clickable Bliss Blog][3] &#8212; major release announcements only
  * [Mike Zornek.com][4] &#8212; discussion of the creation process, coding and design
  * &#8220;Future Product Blog&#8221; &#8212; user experience, tutorials, support, tips and tricks.

It feels great to be building things again. Ever since [my return][5] I&#8217;ve been drowning in accountants, lawyers, agreements and meetings. It&#8217;s been kind of a downer but, with this project starting to get momentum, I&#8217;m feeling great.
