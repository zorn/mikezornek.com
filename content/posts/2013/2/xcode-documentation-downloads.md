Rather that use the Mac App Store and re-download Xcode each time I need to install it on a new Mac, I take advantage of [developer downloads directory][1] and grab the Xcode DMG file so I can put on my USB disk and move around from Mac to Mac and avoid the duplicate downloads.

Xcode however no longer includes the documentation, so the first thing that happens after you launch is a 1.3 GB download for the docs.

Apple, please consider adding a download with a snapshot of the documentation in place. Maybe even a LAN sync option so it could grab the docs from my desktop (or my co-workers) instead of saturating my internet connection all the time.
