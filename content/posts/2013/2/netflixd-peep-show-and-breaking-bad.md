When it comes to TV, you can usually catch me watching a mix of local sports. On the weekends, it might be some This Old House or Gordon Ramsey.

I don&#8217;t tend to get into the episodic TV shows when they are actually released. I&#8217;d much prefer to watch these in bunches. Back in the day, it would be West Wing one DVD at a time but now, with Netflix and other streaming services, it is dangerously easy to lose a whole Saturday streaming one episode after another. Of my recent Netflix binges, two shows have been extremely enjoyable&#8230;

[![Peep Show][1]][2]

[Peep Show][2] is a British comedy shot in first person POV with lots of internal character narration. The show itself is about two flatmates. Mark is a financially secure, but awkward and socially inept middle-aged man, with a pessimistic and cynical attitude. Jeremy, aka &#8220;Jez&#8221;, is an unemployed would-be musician who recently moved in with Mark after breaking up with his girlfriend. Jeremy has a more positive, laid-back approach to life and, while he is better with the girls, he isn&#8217;t nearly as good as he thinks he is.

The comedy is cringe-inducing and hilarious. While some of the plot lines in the later seasons are predictable, there is still a ton on enjoyment in seeing how the characters of Mark and Jez find their way through everything. You&#8217;ll know whether this is your kind of show after a few episodes, but do give the POV perspective some time to get used to. I really enjoyed Peep Show and may even give it a second pass in time.

Note: As I write this, I don&#8217;t see it listed for Netflix streaming anymore although [Hulu][3] might be a working option.

[![Breaking Bad][4]][5]

The other show is far more well-known and that is [Breaking Bad][5]. My cousins have been on me to watch this show for years and I finally gave in. Breaking Bad is great TV.

Breaking Bad opens with the main character Walter White, an overqualified high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. To help provide for his family, he partners with former student and drug dealer Jesse to cook and sell methamphetamine. In time, shit hits the fan in multiple ways that result in entertainment for us. The writing is great, the acting is great and even the cinematography is great.

There are 5 seasons in total of Breaking Bad. Seasons 1 through 4 are on Netflix and the first half of season 5 premiered on AMC in 2012. The last half will premier in the summer of 2013.

Hope you enjoyed the recommendations. If you have any for me, let me know via [email][6] or [twitter][7].
