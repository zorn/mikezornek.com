> Unbelievable that Old Biff could&#8217;ve chosen that particular date. It could mean that that point in time inherently contains some sort of cosmic significance, almost as if it were the temporal junction point of the entire space-time continuum. On the other hand, it could just be an amazing coincidence.

For those not in the loop (and shame on you!), that is a quote from [Back to the Future 2][1].

For me, the last few weeks sure do feel like a &#8220;temporal junction point&#8221; of sorts. Lots of stuff is going on and I feel like I&#8217;ll look back at January/February 2013 and see dozens of paths that my life could have taken. I&#8217;ve already posted about my general [return to work][2] after a bit of burnout and now I can share something else.

I have sold my first commercial product, [ProfitTrain][3] to another developer. Official info can be found on my [company blog][4]. While I am sad to let ProfitTrain go, I am also happy because, over the last year or so, I haven&#8217;t been able to give the product the attention it warrants. The ProfitTrain users deserve better.

Other developments are, well, still developing. I&#8217;ll share more when the time is right. I can say that, while I won&#8217;t be out of the woods for a few more weeks, I&#8217;m feeling very positive about the upcoming year and am doing a good job of maintaining work/life balance despite the recent stress.
