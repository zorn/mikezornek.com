A podcast idea&#8230;

Introducing **Merge Conflicts** a Cocoa focused debate podcast where people argue for or against different systems / programming patterns. There is a central, ever repeating host who moderates the debate and two guests who argue for either side. Some show ideas include:

  * Core Data vs. Custom SQL
  * Storyboards vs. XIBs
  * Git vs. Mercurial
  * Homebrew vs. MacPorts
  * CocoaPods vs. Manual Code Sharing
  * AppCode vs. Xcode
  * Code generators (like mogenerator) Love Them vs Hate Them
  * TestFlight vs. HockeyApp
  * Kiwi vs. XCTests
  * Retain vs. Release
  * And so on&#8230;

Thoughts? Let me know via [email][1] or the twitters [@zorn][2].
