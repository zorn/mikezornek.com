A collection of accomplishments, notes, and observations about June 2024 (and some early July things too).

## Work

Stress about the future [private equity acquisition of my current employer](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/bain-capital-take-powerschool-private-56-bln-deal-2024-06-07/) looms. There is a high probability of being laid off in early 2025.

My mindset has reverted to treating the employment more like a contract. I am a professional and give them a professional effort. I do my best to have a positive impact on the team. I have however pulled back on long-term corporate growth/responsibility plans, which is sad. I wanted this switch to full-time employment to be more long-lasting.

Outside of work, I need to find focus and figure out what's next.

The June work itself has been varied. Individual contributions towards a large product refactor. Specifically, I have been working to recompose some of our LiveView modules so that they are more organized and also posting notes about ideas for authorization using `on_mount` hooks other members have taken the lead on. During my chore time, I've been investigating production exceptions and working with the leadership to see how to edit the schemas/database table to avoid invalid states.

## Side Projects

Like last month, a few short coding sessions on [Flick](https://github.com/zorn/flick), but not as much as I would have liked.

I keep rethinking the schema design I want. In my last coding session, I even pulled back the ballot to include only a single question to simplify the UI layer.

I am feeling a little time pressure to get something working so I can use this for the Elixir Book Club's next vote.

## Tech Education / Books

Reading [A Philosophy of Software Design, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/173210221X) with the Elixir Book Club. About halfway through. It's a great book and focused. It does not waste your time with excessive pages and gives you much to think about per each small chapter.

Still working through the [Obsidian Field Guide](https://learn.macsparky.com/p/obsidianfg-plus).

Started reading [MYST: The Book of Ti'ana](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61152) (fiction) during my vacation on the beach.

Read another chapter of [Radical Candor](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43263498-radical-candor), which I started in April but kind of forgot about.

Did not do much [Postgres](https://theartofpostgresql.com/) reading this month. I want to get back into that one.

## Video Games / TV

Lots of Stardew Valley. I'm in Winter, Year 2, on my new 1.6 farm.

I play an occasional game of MLB: The Show, but I'm not doing the week-by-week grind like last year.

Bought and played some of the new Riven remaster.

Finished [Dark Matter](https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/originals/dark-matter/). I liked it a lot.

Started Better Call Saul. I'm in the middle of season 3.

## Baseball

Watching and listening a bunch. They are the best team in baseball!

## Walks and Exercise

Some walks but not much. I want to get into a swim schedule in the coming weeks.

## Other Notes

I posted last month about some mind fog, lack of focus/drive, and that has continued but is a little better. Need to get into a rhythm towards some new projects. I need purpose.

I did enjoy a week down the shore in June with my sister. Mostly just beach time, but it was great, and we had great weather.

## What's Next?

After some vacation and holiday time, I have some full 5-day work weeks ahead. Need to find a productive rhythm both in and outside those hours.

Later in August I will be headed down to ElixirConf, which will be fun. If you see me, please do say hello.
