A collection of accomplishments, notes, and observations about December 2023.

## Work

This month, I started my new job, putting in about three weeks before the holiday, which the company was fully closed for, which was nice.

The first week was a lot of general onboarding activities and some social/cultural events. After getting the code, I started to make some small technical contributions. However, I avoided any fundamental changes to the domain logic of the app (as I still had/have a lot to learn about education accounting).

In week two, we had two all-hands online company events, which served as a way to share progress, goals, and execution plans. I appreciate the transparency and big picture of these shares. Later, I even had an opportunity to have 1:1 time with the CEO and get more details. I always view myself as a well-rounded developer interested in the business as much as technical details, so all of this felt very good.

In week three, I started to bite into more significant tickets, which included a fair amount of time refactoring Live Components into Functional Components and other page layout cleanup (in prep for future work). I gained more experience with planning, organizing, tracking, reviewing, and merging work through all this. I'm still moving more slowly than I'd like, hoping that will pass soon. This week, I also did a lengthy product tour with one of the product managers (the first of a few meetings), which was very helpful.

Week four was, of course, the Christmas break.

## Side Projects

[StudyHall](https://github.com/studyhall-project/studyhall) continues to be very stagnant, spending my spare time this month on Christmas things and resting (new job info consumption can be very draining day-to-day).

## Tech Education / Books

Finished listening to [The Martian audio book](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6082118016).

Still reading [Observability Engineering: Achieving Production Excellence](https://info.honeycomb.io/observability-engineering-oreilly-book-2022) though slower as of late.

Still reading [Build a Weather Station with Elixir and Nerves](https://pragprog.com/titles/passweather/build-a-weather-station-with-elixir-and-nerves/) for Elixir Book Club, which also included some limited hardware acquisition and assembly.

Still reading [Myst: Book of Atrus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/159764.The_Book_of_Atrus).

## Video Games

Jumping around a bit.

Bought and played Mario RPG. Still playing MLB: The Show some. Started Red Dead 1, but not too far in. Reinstalled Civilization 6 on a bit of a whim over the holiday break. Also started a brand new Stardew Valley farm one night (though I'm viewing it as a temp farm and will likely re-roll once the 1.6 update comes out).

## Walks and Exercise

Pretty low activity. I am tracking about one good walk a week.

My work schedule is pretty flexible, so I should be able to start getting some regular exercise in before work, BUT like anything -- I need to make it happen.

## What's Next?

Looking ahead to January, my big goal is to get into a flow with my new job. Secondary is a goal to determine my priorities in my new limited side project time. Do I want to continue to StudyHall or focus on something more contained? I'm not sure.

I also need to continue to hand off some small client work to new folks.

I also have to get a handle on my new income, budget, and benefit changes aligned (alongside the cancellation of my previous health insurance).
