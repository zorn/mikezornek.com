Wednesday, September 28, 2022 -- Woke up around 8am and after a some breakfast headed out to run errands.

At Target I picked up a new shower curtain and bathroom mats for the new apartment. Going to try to prepare so that some minimal living conditions are all in place before the apartment move happens on Tuesday. I don't want to be in a state where I have to hunt for things just to take a nice shower that first night.

I also picked up a few new clear bins. I'll use then for my desk and monitors when it comes time to break those down, but I'd like to keep them functional as long as possible.

On the way home I stopped by the bank to get some cash for the movers. I got extra to cover any unexpected increases and to make sure I can tip them well. That is such back breaking work, it is the least I can do.

Back home I packed up a fair amount of the kitchen and assembled some new boxes I ordered from Amazon overnight. Should be good now with plenty of extra bubble wrap to encase the larger TV.

I've been skipping my walks so far this week after having my upper leg bother me Sunday into Monday. Its doing much better now but will probably give it another day or so of rest before trying any longer hike.

Overall this week I've been prioritizing time sensitive packing but finally feel caught up and going to try to focus on some work stuff over the next few days.

On Saturday I get the new apartment keys and will move over a few fragile items (like wine glasses some computer monitors I'd prefer to handle myself.
