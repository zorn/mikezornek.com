If you have an active side project, I highly recommend you invest some of your valuable and limited time into ticket/issue creation to **plan out your work**. Specifically, you should **build up a collection** of ready-for-work tiny tickets in the **10-20 minute time completion** range.

So often, we look forward to long **"deep work" programming sessions** to make meaningful progress on our side projects, but they are **few and far between**. We have tons of other life responsibilities from work, family, and friends that will have priority on our time. If we **wait for perfect work sessions** to make progress, our side projects will **take much longer** to complete, and the **risk of failure** (due to personal distractions or loss of motivation) **increases drastically**.

You need to find ways to **move your side project forward** during the **cracks of daily life**, hopefully setting up the foundation of a **productive habit loop**. Have a little time before bed; here is a tiny ticket to do. Have time to kill waiting for a zoom meeting to start; find a tiny ticket to knock out. Many will be **mindless dependency updates** or **small refactors** but little by little, your project will **grow**.
