‚ù§Ô∏è¬†**Feeling:** Another low energy coding day day. Just not feeling it.

‚úÖ **Accomplishments(Tuesday):** Bought my conference ticket and plane ticket for [ElixirConf 2022]. Going for the training day as well. Opted for the Instrumenting Elixir Applications class. Finished reading my [testing book], it was really good. Also bookmarked the [Domain-Driven Design in Practice course][course] of the same author. Seems relevant to my interests. Watched the Phillies [come back] (again) in the ninth to win it. They are on fire.

[ElixirConf 2022]: https://2022.elixirconf.com/
[testing book]: https://www.manning.com/books/unit-testing
[course]: https://enterprisecraftsmanship.com/online-training
[come back]: https://www.mlb.com/gameday/phillies-vs-brewers/2022/06/07/661205

ü•Ö **Goals:** Feeling kind of low energy so don't have too much planned for the day. Need to go back out as I forgot to pickup my prescription refill while doing other morning errands. Will be hosting the Philly Elixir meetup later tonight which I expect to be a mostly social catchup with people. I have nothing formal to present. Maybe some book reading during the day but as I type this I expect to grind some video game baseball after publishing.

üÜò **Help:** I'll be headed to the shore soon‚Ñ¢ and welcome book recommendations, work or play.
