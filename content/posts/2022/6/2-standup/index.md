‚ù§Ô∏è¬†**Feeling:** Pretty good. I have to be careful not to over-medicate on the coffee with my extra reading time. I could have quickly gone over my three-cup limit yesterday. It is something I gravitate to while in my reading chair.

‚úÖ **Accomplishments(Wednesday):** Did some more laundry and am caught up. Blogged a bit about my [vacation plans]. Read chapter 8 of [Unit Testing: Principles, Practices, and Patterns][testing]. Pulled the trigger on a [new laptop purchase][laptop]. Attended a Test Double internal hangout where someone presented their Elixir / Phoenix app that ran a [Schulze method] voting system. The presentation also included some hot takes on hosting on [Fly.io], which is a hosting platform I am considering for future projects. At night played an event in MLB: The Show to earn a [Jimmy Rollins] card. It will take 15 wins to get, I played 9 3-inning games and only won 3 of them. Depending on how that goes next play session, I might just buy the card using the in-game currency as it is pretty cheap. We'll see. Watched [Phillies beat the Giants][game] 6 to 5.

ü•Ö **Goals:** Morning VR workout (done!). Read chapter 9 in my [Unit Testing: Principles, Practices, and Patterns][testing] book. Do some project idea auditing to see if I can work out what I'd like to work on over the break.

üÜò **Help:** I'll be headed to the shore soon‚Ñ¢ and welcome book recommendations, work or play.
