In February I lost my mother to cancer and it was devastating. There is no getting over it but I'm learning to live this new branch of my life. Computers do not make this easy.

In my experience (and others according to my previous grief counseling) I tend to have waves of grief usually kicked off by a small memory. Computers have this awful habit of highlighting memories at unwanted moments. Sometimes it can be as blunt as a recommended photo but other times I find search results for things like email kick them off too.

I don't know what the answer is here, but I suspect this is one of those examples where the user experience development team probably lacks a diverse pool of older developers. I wonder how many on the development have lots love ones who have lost love ones.


ðŸ˜¢ I'm curious, for anyone who has lost a loved one, do you get waves of grief when you stumble into old email threads with that person?

It hits me hard and is more common than I would have thought.

Similar feels to the computer/phone recommending I look at certain old photos on any one day.
