description: A fun little quote from my current audio book.

I've currently reading/listening to [We Are Legion (We Are Bob)](https://www.audible.com/pd/We-Are-Legion-We-Are-Bob-Audiobook/B01L082HJ2) on Audible. 

I'm still on the fence if I'd recommend it or not but really enjoyed this quote:

> At one time, we thought that the way life came together was almost completely random, only needing an energy gradient to get going. But as we've moved into the information age, we've come to realize that life is more about information than energy. 
> 
> Fire has most of the characteristics of life. It eats, it grows, it reproduces. But fire retains no information. It doesn't learn; it doesn't adapt. The five millionth fire started by lightning will behave just like the first. But the five hundredth bacterial division will not be like the first one, especially if there is environmental pressure. That's DNA. And RNA. That's life.

Pretty cool to think of DNA as memory.
