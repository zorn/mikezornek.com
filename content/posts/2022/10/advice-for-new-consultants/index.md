description: Build in public as much as possible, blog what you learn to teach others and when you have time, don't be afraid to approach the people/projects you care about and ask, "how can I help?"

Was introduced to a new member of the Philly CocoaHeads who is starting out as an iOS consultant. He asked for my advice and I figured I'd share it will you all too:

> Nice to meet you too. I'll keep my eye out for new work. I usually share gigs in the `#gig-swap` channel when they find me. I am no longer doing iOS development (doing Elixir / Phoenix web apps instead), but I hear about things from time to time.
>
> My biggest recommendation is to network and meet as many people as possible. Be shameless about sharing your contracting availability and short-term goals. Most of the work I get is through my little circle of work friends.
>
> Also, build in public as much as possible, blog what you learn to teach others and when you have time, don't be afraid to approach the people/projects you care about and ask, "how can I help?"
>
> Good luck to ya.

What did I miss? [Let me know.](/contact)
