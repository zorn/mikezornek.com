Tuesday, July 26, 2022 -- Attended the Phillies game last night. They [came back](https://twitter.com/NBCSPhilly/status/1551919037705224193) to defeat the Braves with a 3-run home run by Bryson Stott in the bottom of the eighth inning! It was glorious.

Before the game, I started working on [some notes](https://twitter.com/zorn/status/1551657268327976961) for my fall consulting search. As a consultant, it is always a bit challenging as I need to demo my Elixir skills, but the client code is obviously not available to show. I think I have some good notes as well as some projects and blog posts from my [ElixirFocus](https://elixirfocus.com/) site.

I'm doing some coding work today, trying to finish my first pass at my Commanded CQRS/Event Source blog project. In short, it's a basic first pass at commands, events, and other systems to help me figure out the patterns I want to use. Today I'm specifically trying to get my head around validation and how I want to do that, knowing I'll want `Ecto.Changeset` structs available for the web layer.
