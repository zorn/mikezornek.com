Saturday, July 30, 2022 -- It has been a calm week, and I am happy to have it. 

On Wednesday met up with my Aunt for dinner at one of our local pub/pizza place. Then on Thursday my sister and I headed up to PARX Casino for a nicer dinner and a few quick sessions of misplaced hopes with the slot machines. I was particularly bummed I did not get one BIG spin on the Wheel of Fortune game. It is all I was looking for. At least the steak dinner was good, very good actually.

On Friday, I headed into town for a day at IndyHall. I have not been down as much during my vacation time, and it was good to catch up with some folks. While at the hall, I made some noteworthy progress on my [blog project](https://mikezornek.com/posts/2022/6/side-project-idea-audit/). Feeling pretty confident I'll have something to demo at the next Philly Elixir meetup.

As much as I enjoy catching up with people at IndyHall, I can't say I look forward to city visits much anymore. It feels sad to see the continued growth of homelessness and the continued neglect of the streets, with trash piled up all over. I don't feel as safe as I used to. Even with my intentionally limited attention, I am well aware of gun violence in the city.

Plans for today and the rest of the weekend are light and include some more packing of mom's things and other apartment cleanup efforts. I skipped my morning walk today due to some soreness in my feet but plan a longer walk and maybe some swim time tomorrow.
