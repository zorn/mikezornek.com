Sunday, July 24, 2022 -- I'm back from my mid-week Baseball Hall of Fame trip. [A recap with photos](https://mikezornek.com/posts/2022/7/baseball-hall-of-fame/) has been posted if you are curious how it went. Other updates below.

On Friday, I checked out another apartment that I think might work for me. It is a two-floor / two-bedroom rental in a townhome-style layout. I like how it is in a quiet area with a walking trail and park nearby. It is a 30-minute drive from my current place, the edge of the radius I am targeting, as I don't want to be too far from my sister and other family. Need to talk with the leasing agent some more, but I have good hopes.

As for my current place, they continue to be no-show, no-work at removing the remaining moldy drywall and addressing other issues. It is embarrassing.

Yesterday, Saturday, I enjoyed a morning swim at the YMCA and then attended the Philly CocoaHeads Side Project Saturday. It was our first in-person meetup in two years. There were 5 of us, and we took over a little loft area at a bar in Jenkintown. Worked on that [Cooperstown recap](https://mikezornek.com/posts/2022/7/baseball-hall-of-fame/) and enjoyed some friendly conversations.

Today, Sunday, I set my alarm for 6:30am and, after breakfast, was out the door for my morning walk by 7:15am. Another scorcher today, so I wanted to do my walk as early as possible. While I was walking, it was around 85°, but the high is predicted to hit 100° later today. I adjusted my walking path to take advantage of as much shade as possible. Might have to avoid the sun and stay indoors tomorrow. Perhaps another YMCA trip or do my VR workout.

No other notable plans for the day outside of some laundry. I have the Phillies on the radio and may work on the event-sourced blog project a bit. I also have some apartment-related paperwork to review.

One feeling that is gnawing at me as the new week approaches is that vacation time is over, and I need to be more work-productive with my time in the coming days. I've loosely started talking with people about possible Elixir projects but not sure what I want to do just yet. I need to get heads-down and do **something** to find the momentum.
