Exercism, the popular platform that teaches programming via structured coding exercises, is going to be hosting [a free August cohort for their Elixir track](https://exercism.org/cohorts/exhort-aug-22). They brand the endeavour an "Exhort".

> The Exhort is simple. We'll give you and a bunch of other learners a space to learn together, add in some of our best mentors and Exercism experts, and support you as you work together through the Exercism Elixir syllabus over 30 days.
>
> - 100% free
> - Starts August 8th. Lasts for 30 days.
> - Work through the track in your own time
> - Pair with each other or work as individuals
> - Commit to sharing your journey, and supporting others

I did a few lessons of the Elixir track last year when the new version of Exercism was launched and was impressed with how it all worked. The cohort sounds fun and a nice way for me to mingle with other looking to learn Elixir.

My plan is to record my work through the sessions and the first video / exercise is shared below.

For now I'm distributing these on my [personal YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/MikeZornek). The videos are pretty raw and longer than some historical educational content I've produced. I sharing my failures as well as my victories. It could be longer content than some might expect but I could see others enjoying seeing me work through the errors and typos too. We'll see how it goes.

I also think the 30-day scope of the cohort helps me invest in the video series without worrying about a long-term content commitment to people. I'm still on the fence how I want to split my time in the coming months.
