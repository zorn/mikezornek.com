Tuesday, August 23, 2022 -- As the great Barbra Streisand [sings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWrNZ6SySfg): "People; People who need people; Are the luckiest people in the world." (1)

After a few needed days of rest from my vacation (love how that logic works) I had an enjoyable extended weekend catching up with folks. Saw a friend for lunch on Friday, attended the in-person Philly CocoaHead Side Project Saturday on (you guessed it) Saturday, and then a family kid's birthday party on Sunday. Otherwise been slowly ordering moving boxes and doing some todos related to my upcoming apartment move. I won't start packing for another few weeks, but getting everything organized and also having some friends stop by and take a few furniture pieces I won't be taking with me.

My [Elixir Exercism video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcuknvxBZ9L6wgG61cQnfyjfNUSFX2G5O) continues on a slow but steady pace. Feeling pretty good about that and even started to promote it in a few places.

Also starting to bang the drum on my [consulting availability](https://mikezornek.com/posts/2022/8/elixir-consulting-availability/) a little louder. I am even considering getting name badges with "Hire me" on them for ElixirConf.

Speaking of, ElixirConf is next week, and I'm looking forward to it. I fly out on Monday, do a training day, and then the official conference. I'll share more later, but if you happen to read this and will be there, please do say hi.

That's it for nowâ€”time for lunch and some office cleanup.

(1) This is a big inside joke for me. Whenever I'd be with my mother, and we'd observe or otherwise get frustrated with people driving recklessly or doing other shameful things out in public, I would start singing this song, expressing my innate default response to be a recluse.
