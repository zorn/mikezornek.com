In today's Exercism Elixir Track video, we learn about Bitstrings and Tail Call Recursion while completing the DNA Encoding exercise.

Today's recording did not go nearly as bad as the Regular Expressions one but I still struggled with the Elixir Bitstring syntax and this took longer than needed. Bonus round of disappointment, you'll get to see me with a haircut I did not like (and has since been 'fixed').
