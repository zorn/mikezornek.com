My summer vacation is coming to a close and I am once again looking for my next consulting project.

An ideal project would involve a healthy mix of:

- Elixir/Phoenix programming
- Product and user interface design
- Technical documentation writing
- Mentoring junior developers (or those new to Elixir)
- Open source projects would be a plus
- Quality assurance and testing could be a good fit too.

I am interested in both part time and full time engagement opportunities.

If you have a project or referral please [shoot me an email](mailto:zorn@zornlabs.com) or [grab some time on my calendar](https://savvycal.com/zorn/chat).
