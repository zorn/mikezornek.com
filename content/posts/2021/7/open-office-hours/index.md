With some well earned [extended summer downtime](/posts/2021/6/summer-plans/) underway I once again have a more flexible schedule and want to promote my open office hours!

Open office hours for me is a great way to give back to the community and hear what people are excited about and working on. Noting too formal, just coffee over a Zoom video chat. Recommend discussion topics might include:

* Code questions about Elixir, Phoenix or Ecto
* Software testing strategies
* Team communication challenges
* Website structure and design
* Product development
* Customer research
* Static website development with Hugo
* Technical presentations and teaching

Slots are 1 hours in length to allow for breathing room but need not go the full time.
