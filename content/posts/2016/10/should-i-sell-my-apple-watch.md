I did not partake in the first release of Apple Watch. I was curious but not curious enough. I bought a Playstation 4 instead.

Last month Apple had its announcements. I wasn&#8217;t all that jazzed about the iPhone 7 (even though I am due to upgrade my iPhone 6) so I thought I&#8217;d try out the watch instead. I ordered an Apple Watch Series 2, 42mm Stainless Steel w/ Silver Milanese Loop. I also got a Cocoa Sport Band for a little variety.

It&#8217;s been about a month with the watch and I&#8217;m not sure I should keep it. Few notes:

- I suspect a big benefit of the watch is quick glances at notifications &#8212; but for me, I&#8217;m actively trying to remove notifications from my life. I turn them off completely on the desktop and audit them on iOS significantly.
- There is the health tracker / movement component, but for me it&#8217;s not a huge draw. I don&#8217;t do heavy workouts much. I do like to take the occasional podcast walk, but I feel like I get enough info from my phone&#8217;s step counter if I really cared.
- I don&#8217;t like the pressure that I need to wear the watch all day to fill up my bars. I did not wear a watch before this and it still feels very alien. I like taking it off when I type on my laptop or after I wash my hands (it gets wet and doesn&#8217;t dry off right away).
- I find myself constantly fiddling with the magnet strap. I like the band to be slightly tight and it feels like it get loose quickly if I move my arms a certain way (putting on my backpack, making my bed, etc.).
- The sport band strap is too small for me (even with the larger of the two bands) &#8212; it technically fits but is too tight. One more hole would have helped.

Am I missing something? What do you love about your Apple Watch? [Let me know.][1] As of now, I&#8217;m looking for ways to sell it &#8212; I think the money for me would be better put towards a new Mac (should they ever be rev&#8217;d again).
