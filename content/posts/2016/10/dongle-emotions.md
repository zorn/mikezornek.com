After letting my bedroom / office get out of hand, I took some time today to clean up and get organized. [I wrapped and grouped up my wires][1] and even opened up [some of the new USB3/Thunderbolt3 dongles][2] I had ordered to go along with my [new MacBook Pro order][3].

Now I don&#8217;t want to get into the current dongle drama surrounding the new MacBook Pro &#8212; but I do have a funny story.

A few years ago I worked as a self-employed contractor doing iOS work. I was at a meeting with a new prospective client. Overall the meeting went well and it looked like we&#8217;d be working together. At the end I was packing up all my gear and there was an accusation that I had taken their projector dongle. I was fairly certain I was in the right and this was a dongle from my laptop bag but did I really want to risk this multi-month contract for a $30 dongle? It was something out of a [Seinfeld episode][4]. Suffice to say, I left the dongle with the client that day to ease tensions.

> Don&#8217;t mess with another man&#8217;s dongle.

These days I mark all my dongles (and I need a ton of them as a traveling instructor not knowing what a room will have) with &#8220;ZORN&#8221; to alleviate confusion.
