[Documentation for NSViewController init(nibName:bundle:) is incorrect][1] from [Mike Zornek][2] on [Vimeo][3].

I say the wrong thing a few times in this spontaneous recording but hopefully there is enough here to reveal the problem. Not a major problem by any means but the Mac frameworks need all the love they can get so let&#8217;s be sure to report the changes we want to see.
