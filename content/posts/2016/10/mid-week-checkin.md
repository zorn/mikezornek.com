It&#8217;s Wednesday night and as expected it&#8217;s been both an exhausting and rewarding week so far here at the [Front End Web class][1]. Here is the table of contents we&#8217;ve been working through:

  * Introduction
  * Chapter 1: Setting Up Your Development Environment
  * Chapter 2: Setting Up Your First Project
  * Chapter 3: Styles
  * Chapter 4: Responsive Layouts with Flexbox
  * Chapter 5: Adaptive Layouts with Media Queries
  * Chapter 6: Handling Events with JavaScript
  * Chapter 7: Visual Effects with CSS
  * Chapter 8: Modules, Objects and Methods
  * Chapter 9: Introduction to Bootstrap
  * Chapter 10: Processing Forms with JavaScript
  * Chapter 11: From Data to DOM
  * Chapter 12: Validating Forms
  * Chapter 13: Ajax
  * Chapter 14: Deferred and Promises
  * Chapter 15: Introduction to Node.js
  * Chapter 16: Real-Time Communication with WebSockets

And what&#8217;s up next:

  * Chapter 17: Using ES6 with Babel
  * Chapter 18: ES6, the Adventure Continues
  * Chapter 19: Introduction to MVC and Ember
  * Chapter 20: Routing, Routes and Models
  * Chapter 21: Models and Data Binding
  * Chapter 22: Data: Adapters, Serializers and Transforms
  * Chapter 23: Views and Templates
  * Chapter 24: Controllers
  * Chapter 25: Components
  * Chapter 26: Afterword

Entering the class I was a little worried that my past web development experience would have made the early chapters moot, but to my enjoyment there is a lot of new web features and tools available since I did Rails full time back in 2012. [Flexbox][2] is particularly interesting and has me excited to do some testing to see if it will help me solve some layout concerns I have in my side project.

I also enjoyed the time we&#8217;ve spent working in pure JavaScript. We built out a very modularized system that would react to a simple coffee order page. I appreciate how we&#8217;ve taken the time to learn JavaScript from the bottom up. It makes you better understand and appreciate what more advanced tools like [Babel][3] and [Ember][4] are doing.

Tonight we closed with web sockets which is something I&#8217;m really hoping to embrace on future projects. Live content, no reload and real-time collaboration is where it&#8217;s at.

And then of course comes the &#8220;ranch&#8221; venue itself. Being able to get away and focus on the learning is priceless. Afternoon walks help clear your head. Here are [some photos][5]. Wish you were here. 🙂
