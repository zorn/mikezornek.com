One of the great perks of working at [Big Nerd Ranch][1] is that you are allowed to take one Big Nerd Ranch class a year. This week I&#8217;m taking the [Front End Web class][2], and am really looking forward to it.

At nights we are encouraged to work on a side project to help practice what we are learning in the day. I think I&#8217;m going to work on a wiki app &#8212; with a few touches that I myself have an itch for, drag and drop image uploads, code syntax coloring, and more.

I&#8217;ll check in later through the week. Wish me luck.
