I&#8217;ve been to multiple [CocoaConfs][1] as an attendee and it&#8217;s with great pride I&#8217;m happy to say I&#8217;ll be a [speaker][2] at one soon.

![CocoaConf Boston][3]

> [CocoaConf][1] is a traveling conference focused on Apple technologies that has been around since 2011. It&#8217;s big enough to have multiple tracks of content but small enough that you&#8217;ll have time to socialize with most of the other speakers and attendees throughout the event.

The 2016 &#8220;tour&#8221; is coming to a close. I&#8217;ll be speaking at the [Washington DC CocoaConf][4] (Sept 9-10) but if you are on the west coast you might want to consider [San Jose, CocoaConf][5] (Nov 4-5th).

When registering use code “COCOAHEADS” for 10% off!

I can&#8217;t wait to see everyone. If you will joining us, please come by and say hi. I&#8217;ll have some [Big Nerd Ranch][6] swag for ya.
