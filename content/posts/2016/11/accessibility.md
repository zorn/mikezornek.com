At the Apple event a few weeks ago they began with a short video on accessibility.

I&#8217;ve learned a lot about accessibility on iOS over the last few years. Apple&#8217;s products are some of the most accessible in the world and for all the frustrations I have with Apple, this is definitely one of the high points I&#8217;m proud of.

I was also really pleased to see our own [Philly CocoaHeads][1] give accessibility some attention at a recent Side Project Saturday event. A group of people worked on improving the accessibility of [the Wikipedia iOS app][2].

Anyways, I think the time is right for development agencies and indy consultants to put accessibility front and center. For them to say loud and proud, any app you hire us to build will have some basic level of accessibility.

Some people whom I bounced this idea off of thought it would be bad for sales. Maybe. But these are the probably the same clients who question code review because they think it is a similar waste of money. At the end of the day we all have have some level of standards onto which we execute our craft. People hire us because they can&#8217;t build software. They need us to point them in the right direction.

Somewhere out there, a construction agency is in a discussion whether or not to add a wheelchair ramp to the current project. Some people will add it because it&#8217;s required by law, others will add it because it&#8217;s the right thing to do.

The software industry moves incredibly fast, maybe even too fast. We don&#8217;t have regulations and inspectors like other industries. We have to regulate ourselves. The tools to improveÂ access for our creations are ready. They work really well. They sit there, waiting for us to use them.

I don&#8217;t want to come off like I&#8217;m some know it all when it comes to accessibility. If you need real help with your app, contact [my friend Austin][4] who does consulting on the subject.

I do have some experience enhancing a few personal iOS apps and hope to make it a larger priority with my upcoming [side project][5]. Like a lot of things, I think the goal here is for continual learning and small, iterative improvements.
