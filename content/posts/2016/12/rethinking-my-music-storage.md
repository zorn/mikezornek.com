I&#8217;m not a huge music collector, at least not compared to some other people I know. I do have about 150 GBs of music in my iTunes collection &#8212; lots of it being video game soundtracks I enjoy listening to while I program.

A few things I have not liked about my historic setup:

- Because the collection was 150 GB I could not store it on my main computer&#8217;s SSD (which was 256 GB in size).
- iTunes sucks. I don&#8217;t want to get into details here but as a music player and organization tool it&#8217;s awful.

Some goals for my new setup:

- I want to get rid of iTunes.
- I&#8217;d like to store my music on Dropbox, preferably in a way where I can control which Music (if any) gets synced to my other Dropbox setups.
- I have recently become a Spotify member. It&#8217;s got a nice collection I feel I can lean on AND it has some tools the player UI to support local files as well as streaming songs which I think will be key.

With all that said, what I&#8217;m up to:

First thing, I made a new iTunes library on my desktop and have started re-downloading my old iTunes music purchases. I have lots of music that is still DRM wrapped and these new downloads do not have such DRM.

Next, I&#8217;m going to slowly start to put the music into Dropbox. I&#8217;ll have a root level `Music` folder but inside I&#8217;m going to split the collection into `Rare` and `Common`. `Common` being for songs that are streamable from Spotify and thus being a folder I can selectively NOT sync on my other computers. The `Rare` folder will have all of my video game soundtracks and other albums I find to be incomplete or missing on Spotify. As I said, I like how Spotify can bring in local music into playlists and even lets you control the source folders and I&#8217;m hopeful this will work nicely.

We&#8217;ll see how it goes over the next few weeks. I&#8217;d love to hear if anyone else has an exotic setup like this.

Also, next up for a rethink is photos. Again, I&#8217;m really not happy with the current Apple solution and am thinking of alternatives. Feedback welcome.
