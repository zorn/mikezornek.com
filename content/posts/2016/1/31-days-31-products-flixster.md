## Day 27: Flixster

> This post is part of [a larger series][1] where for 31 days I&#8217;m posting a story about a particular product or service I&#8217;ve come to enjoy.

We just had a great year of movies and [2016 keeps them coming][2]. The app I use to keep on top of trailers and showtimes is [Flixster][3].

I feel like I installed Flixster when I first got my iPhone. It&#8217;s a great app to launch when you have some time to kill. I love watching trailers and looking at the release calendar.

A free download and simple UI. If you don&#8217;t have [Flixster][3], give it a shot.
