## Day 31: Skitch

> This post is part of [a larger series][1] where for 31 days I&#8217;m posting a story about a particular product or service I&#8217;ve come to enjoy.

[Skitch][2] is a screenshot and notation tool from Evernote. With Skitch you can take screenshots using various options and then annotate them with vibrant pink arrows, shapes and text. Like this:

![Skitch Sample][3]

I really enjoying using Skitch during app audits where I can take a bunch of screenshots on device and then import them for annotations. Having the visual evidence to help back up your argument is really handy. The software itself is fairly strait forward and focused. With an Evernote account it will sync all your files though I usually import and export them as I need.

Skitch is a free download on the [Mac App Store][4] or [directly from the Evernote website][5]. Enjoy!
