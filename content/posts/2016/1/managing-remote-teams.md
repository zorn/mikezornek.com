Local company [Wildbit][1] has been nice enough to host a running series of meetup events focused on running a software business and all that it can entail. Last night we discussed [Managing Remote Teams][2] and as a remote employee myself I was interested to hear what others people had to share. Below are some of my notes.

## Context

In attendance we had about 12 or so people. Many from Wildbit (many of their remote people were in town), but we also had a pair from another small (6+) local software company, one from a local company researching coworking and myself, whom works remotely for the [Big Nerd Ranch][3], down in Atlanta.

## General Observations

- Running an all in-person office has unique organization challenges and benefits.
- Running an all remote office has unique organization challenges and benefits.
- Running a hybrid in-person and remote office has unique organization challenges and benefits.
- Even still, things vary based on the size and work of your company.
- No rules are true for everyone so be flexible.
- Be prepared to spend time and energy on this.

## Why Consider Remote Employees

- Expands your potential hiring pool greatly.
- Very helpful if you are using niche technologies where it can be hard to find experts (Closure, Rust, etc.).
- Potential benefits in having time shifted work (but this can also introduce communication problems, lag).

## How to Get Started

- If you currently have a 100% in-person company, adding remote people will be a significant culture shift. Be prepared.
- No one wants to be the first remote hire on a team.
- Consider adding multiple remotes at once.
- Consider offering work from home to current in-person staff to help the new culture work itself out.

## Challenges

- It can be hard for a remote employee to demonstrate what they are working on.
- Being remote requires more thorough and regular communication than most people expect.
- Lots of people romanticize remote work from [DHH&#8217;s writings][4] and don&#8217;t respect the real life challenges of it all.
- Sometimes with a hybrid company, teams will be setup where you have two people &#8220;in office&#8221; and one person remote on a project. It can be real easy for the two people in office to share more face-to-face leaving the remote person feel left out.
- If you have employees in different states / countries, you have to make sure you are following the approbate employment laws of those states / countries.
- The whole &#8220;programming in your underwear&#8221; trope is really misguided. Most successful remote people have a schedule, take showers, get properly dressed and have a dedicated work spaces.

## Face to Face Retreats

- Everyone seemed to agree that it&#8217;s a bad idea for the remotes to never come together. Everyone benefits from real face to face time so plan for it early.
- Wildbit has yearly company retreats, where they work, plan for the year ahead and otherwise define the goals and values that should guide all their decisions.
- Other companies do more vacation oriented retreats to help connect people socially.
- It was also suggested that depending on the size of the company it could benefit from have some company wide events and then some smaller more team focused events.

## Things You Can Do to Help Remote Employees

- Setup a Slack or HipChat for communication.
  - Additionally try to have people communicate what they are doing. &#8220;Starting feature X&#8221;, Reviewing PR Y&#8221;, &#8220;Stepping out to get some coffee&#8221;, &#8220;Breaking for an hour to watch a conference talk&#8221; &#8212; sharing these can help people better understand what&#8217;s going on.
- Consider giving them an annual office stipend to improve their workspace; equivalent to the money you&#8217;d spend giving them an office in your building.
- Make sure all in-office systems are available to remote folks. Things like file servers, whitelisted IP API access, etc.
- Prefer video chat over audio chat. Seeing human faces helps communication and empathy.
- When running a video chat, consider having even the in-office people stay at their desk and connect to give every &#8220;virtual head&#8221; its own space. (I&#8217;ve also had everyone use their laptop for the video and a shared phone for the voice.
- If you are presenting and the video is going out to remote people, don&#8217;t forget to ask them for questions and check the chat room.
- If you are a manager and are set up to have 1:1 monthly meetings with in-office people, consider offering bi-weekly for remotes &#8212; since they might be more out of sync.

## Equipment

- Some people were enjoying the [HighFive][5] video conferencing hardware &#8212; though they needed more seats than the current solution offers for their company wide stuff.
- BNR&#8217;s recently been using the YouTube Live service to stream and capture video with fair success for our larger meetings / internal educational talks.
- One AV tool BNR uses is a toss-able chat box that contains a microphone so after large meetings, during Q and A, the remote folks can hear the questions being asked.
- [The Double][6] was brought up reguarding its use as a virtual presence. It&#8217;s cool stuff but of questionable return value.

Hope you enjoyed my notes. If you have anything to share about your own remote work [let me know][7].
