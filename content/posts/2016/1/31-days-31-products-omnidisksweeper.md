## Day 30: OmniDiskSweeper

> This post is part of [a larger series][1] where for 31 days I&#8217;m posting a story about a particular product or service I&#8217;ve come to enjoy.

When choosing software for this series I particularly get a kick out of linking to products I suspect many might not know about. With that in mind, tonight I present OmniDiskSweeper!

[OmniDiskSweeper][2] is a little app from the OmniGroup they&#8217;ve been distributing for years that let&#8217;s you scan a hard drive and sort every folder by the size its taking up. OmniDiskSweeper is a great tool to use when you are trying to figure out how to trim down your hard disk usage.

I currently have an iMac whose main system drive is a 256 GB SSD and between my Dropbox, video games and video editing work it&#8217;s very easy to fill up. Using OmniDiskSweeper I quickly figure out what needs to get deleted or migrated to my external media drive when free space gets too small.

OmniDiskSweeper is [a free download][2]. Enjoy.
