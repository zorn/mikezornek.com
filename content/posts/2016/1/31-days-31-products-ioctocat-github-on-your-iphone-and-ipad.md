## Day 29: iOctocat, GitHub on your iPhone and iPad

> This post is part of [a larger series][1] where for 31 days I&#8217;m posting a story about a particular product or service I&#8217;ve come to enjoy.

For mobile GitHub management nothing beats [iOctocat][2]. If you find yourself on the road and needing to check in with GitHub this is a must have app. I use it mostly for keeping track of pull requests and getting push notification of status changes.

iOctocat is a [free download on the App Store][3] with in-app purchased to unlock a Pro feature set for $14.
