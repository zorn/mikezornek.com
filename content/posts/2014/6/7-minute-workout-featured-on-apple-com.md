One of the apps I worked on, [7 Minute Workout][1], has been featured by Apple again. This time it&#8217;s part of the [Strength TV ad][2] which features a bunch of great fitness apps on iOS.

In related new the DmgCtrl and Tonic merger is kind of official these days. You can read more about it in [Technical.ly Philly][3]. You can also check out the revamped [Tonic website][4] which has a bunch of new case studies of some of our recent projects.

Congrats to all involved.
