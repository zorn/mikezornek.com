I love coming up with fun names for my computer hardware. My computers typically are named after video game characters, for example my Mac mini CI server is called [GLaDOS][1]. She loves to test. My phones have similar names.

![Ash's Pokemon Dex][2]

For my first iPhone, an iPhone 4, I named it Dex after the device Ash uses in Pokemon to look up information. (Not to be confused with the app of the same name I made months later to do just that.)

![Navi][3]

For my next phone, an iPhone 5, I choose &#8220;Navi&#8221;, named after the sometimes helpful yet interruption loving fairy side kick of Link in Zelda: Ocarina of Time.

![Ziggy][4]

For my new iPhone 6 I went with Ziggy, as in the device / computer AI from [Quantum Leap][5]. Feels appropriate for a device where I put in data and ask for advice.

As for the iPhone 6 itself, I think it&#8217;s pretty cool (really like the Touch ID and can&#8217;t wait to test Apple Pay) &#8212; though I am [worried about dropping this phone][6]. Not the easiest device to grip. Feels very smooth, too smooth.
