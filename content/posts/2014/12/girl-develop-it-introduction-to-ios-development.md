The [Introduction to iOS Development][1] class I&#8217;m teaching for Girl Develop It is open and tickets are for sale.

> This class will provide attendees an introduction into iOS development through a mix of lecture-style presentations and lots of hands on coding exercises that in total will demonstrate what it is like to be an iOS developer.

The 2-day class costs $100 and will be held on Saturday Feb 7th and Sunday Feb 8th.

If you know of a woman in the Philadelphia area who is interested in iOS please let them know. Thanks.
