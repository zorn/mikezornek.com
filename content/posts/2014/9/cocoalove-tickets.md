It&#8217;s September, which means next month is October, which means [CocoaLove][1] is coming up fast!

We&#8217;ve got a great weekend planned and if you haven&#8217;t already secured your ticket I&#8217;d [do so now][2] since we are starting our last marketing push to sell out.

Additionally, if you or a company you know are interested in sponsoring to help show your support for CocoaLove let me know. CocoaLove is passion project from some great folks out of our [local CocoaHeads chapter][3] who have donated countless hours in helping to organize this incredible non-profit event. Sponsor support will help us reach our stretch goals and make an already great experience that much better.

See you all soon!
