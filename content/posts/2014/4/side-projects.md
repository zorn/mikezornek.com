Sorry for the dead air over the last few months. Things got a bit hectic at my job and I couldn&#8217;t seem to find the free time to post. On the plus side, things are starting to calm down. We&#8217;ve shipped some more software and I&#8217;m finally catching up with some side projects.

One project which I started at the March [CocoaHead][1] Hackday is **GoldCards**. It&#8217;s an iOS reference tool for [Hearthstone][2].

While I want this to be a Universal (iPhone and iPad) app in time I think I&#8217;m going to finish up a few more loose ends and release it as an iPhone-only app for now.

Another big side project is [CocoaLove][9], an iOS-focused conference coming to Philly. I&#8217;m on the planning committee (sponsorship and AV to be specific). I&#8217;d also like to help build a simple conference app with the schedule and what not. Shouldn&#8217;t be too hard considering my history with such things.

In addition to all that I&#8217;m also trying to catch up with some web tech, Ember and Node to be precise. There are a few things on my idea board that could utilize such skills so I&#8217;m taking some time reading [books][10] and going through [Code School examples][11] to catch up.
