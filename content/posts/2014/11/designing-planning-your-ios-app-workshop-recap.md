Workshops are a new effort from the [Philly CocoaHeads][1] group. Basic idea is: one workshop every other month, the workshop is a one day 5-6 hour event, that covers a single topic. Our first one was on Intermediate Objective-C and our second one, which was held last Saturday, covered [Designing & Planning Your iOS App][2].

![Kotaro Teaching][3]

Overall the workshop went well. Kotaro Fujita was our main presenter and did a great job of alternating lecture and hands on exercise. At the end, attendees presented what they had worked on and how their app ideas were evolving. The crowd was great with lots of great feedback too. Some of my notes:

  * When brainstorming features consider using index cards or mind mapping software. I like [MindNode Pro][4] and [Trello][5].

  * Spend LOTS of time wire framing, sketching, etc. Be mindful to separate your design time from your production coding time. It&#8217;s easy to fall into trap where you are coding things that will not work and this is very expensive. Way better to validate your designs with prototyping first.

  * Document what problem each screen is suppose to solve. Also document the emotions you expect the user to have. For example, on first launch what is your user asking themselves, how can you help educate them? Are you using verbiage they understand? How fast can you deliver your first WOW moment?

  * Get users involved as soon as possible. Preferably before you start to code. Should have some level of idea validation before starting.

  * Once you release a build, make customer support your highest priority. Answer every email/tweet within the hour. Let them call you. Doing this is a huge part of getting people to trust you and then later recommending you and your product.

## Related Resources

In the spirit of the talk I wanted to share some other related resources.

So there are two great online courses going on right now regarding starting a startup people might be interested in:

  * Stanford&#8217;s Startup Class <http://startupclass.samaltman.com>
  * Philly Startup Leaders&#8217;s Startup Bootcamp: <http://phillystartupleaders.org/>

Some of it is a little heavy on the VC-funding but otherwise lots of great things to think about.

Another video I find really helpful to watch and re-watch whenever thinking about which projects I want to work on: [How great leaders inspire action by Simon Sinek][6]. His explanation of &#8220;Why/How/What&#8221; is very inspiring for me.

For some design fundamentals consider reading [Design for non Designers by Robin Williams][7] and [Don&#8217;t Make Me Think by Steve Krug][8]

Finally I&#8217;ll mention the the [Lean Startup Book][9] which I [reviewed back in 2013][10]. It still is a favorite book of mine with some awesome ideas on working fast and based on validations and learning.
