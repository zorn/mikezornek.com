[CocoaLove][1] was a huge success. All of the talks were well received and the attendee side conversations vibrant and interesting. I think I saw 2 laptops open all weekend which to me is a huge sign people were engaged with our content. If you missed out, check out the [CocoaLove][2] site for some highlights of our tweet/photo live stream.

While they&#8217;ll never capture the event in its full glory, we did record the presentations and will be editing them over the next few weeks to make the available on the web. To find out when the videos are up I&#8217;d signup to the mailing list or follow the [@CocoaLoveConf][3] twitter account.

I want to thank my fellow organizers, the speakers and the attendees for helping provide a weekend I&#8217;ll remember forever.

In particular I&#8217;ll give special props to [Curtis][4] whom sacrificed countless hours attending to hundreds of details that resulting in a level conference quality that is hard to achieve. Great job!
