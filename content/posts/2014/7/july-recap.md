I&#8217;d hate to go a month without posting so here&#8217;s some random updates!

[Philly CocoaHeads][1] is going as strong as ever. Our WWDC June meeting filled the Apple Store Briefing Room to capacity (~50 people!) with lots of excited geeks. Our Side Project Saturday events continue to see some steady growth (15 people at the July event) and generate lotsÂ of interesting conversation and shared ideas. (Funny enough we were talking app bubbles right along side [Edge Cases][2] this week even though I didn&#8217;t know their topic at the time.) Finally our workshops are finally kicking back into gear with an [Intermediate Objective-C course][3] coming in August and a more beginner friendly [Introduction to iOS Development][4] course via the Girl Develop It group in September. Philly CocoaHeads is becoming so formal in fact I think we&#8217;re going to take the plunge and make it a legit non-profit group to help clean up the financial side of things.

In addition to CocoaHeads, there is also [CocoaLove][5] &#8212; our upcoming Fall conference. I&#8217;ll be doing the main talk Friday night and I&#8217;m doing my best to keep the topic upbeat despite my pessimistic tendencies. Big props to [Curtis Herbert][6] for really spearheading this event. It looks to be a really interesting and fun weekend. Buy your ticket while you can!

Through my job at [Tonic Design][7] things are busy. I have two projects right now, One is for a startup while another an internal app for a large corporation. Sadly these are not public right now so details will have to wait. That said, I&#8217;ve been spending a ton of time with iOS animations and I have two things to say. One, the [Facebook Pop][8] system is pretty cool and worthy of your time to play with. Two, I&#8217;m working on an abstraction system that should help apps with large amounts of animation stay organized. More to come soon on that.

At home, side projects have been back burnered, mostly for CocoaHeads stuff. I am spending time reading up on Swift and playing a little with [Go][9] but I&#8217;m also trying to keep plenty of time for playing games and relaxing. Can&#8217;t be focused on code all the time.

So thats it for July. Hope the summer is treating you all well. Hope to share more soon.
