## Things I like about iOS Development

  * I like writing code in the Objective-C language.
  * I like Apple&#8217;s provided frameworks and tools. They are, on the whole, very good.
  * I like the iOS community&#8217;s enthusiasm for great products. It is very inspiring.
  * I like that people will pay you good money to build apps for them in iOS. Though this is has good and bad implications.
  * I love attending, and over the last few years running, CocoaHeads in Philadelphia.
  * I like that the community on a whole is not very secretive. There is a sense we are in this together and people constantly help each other out sharing tips, code and war stories.

## Things I hate about iOS Development

  * I hate the exclusivity of the AppStore distribution.
  * I hate that I can&#8217;t side load apps that people build that Apple doesn&#8217;t approve of.
  * I hate that I have to sign my apps. 
  * I hate the learning curve and the bugs of the signing process for all but especially for people new to iOS.
  * I hate that Apple has a shitty code validator during app signing that will complain when I have methods on my objects that look like private methods on their objects.
  * I hate how shitty AppStore search and discovery is.
  * I hate the corporate politics that let apps get featured in the store because of &#8220;connections&#8221;.
  * I hate how people continue to manipulate the AppStore ranking system and I hate how little Apple seems improve the situation when many small developers livelihoods are at stake.
  * I hate how the Radar bug system doesn&#8217;t have tools in place to involve and update the original bug reporter on progress being made. From a third-party perspective most bug reports might as well go into a black hole.
  * I hate how in the pit of my stomach I believe that, on the whole, the iPhone and its brethren have not improved society. I think the majority of mobile software has only helped to empower &#8220;generation &#8216;me'&#8221;, a generation that is &#8220;friends&#8221; with everyone, but no one. This deserves a post on to itself someday.
  * I hate the iOS / Mobile bubble. The fact that people are spending way too much building apps and are not getting a proper return of value on the investment.
  * I hate that building products is way riskier than consulting (bubble related).
  * I hate that Apple hasn&#8217;t shown more interest in providing a library management system. Thankfully we have CocoaPods but since it&#8217;s on the outside there is a fear it might not be able to keep up as the tool chain evolves.
  * I hate that back when Apple first started to integrate OCUnit into Xcode it enviably killed like 3 or 4 other very promising testing systems because the thought at the time was &#8220;well Apple made their choice and will build on it&#8221; when in fact Apple never did. Only recently did we see XCTest and it is, right now from a functional perspective, a method renamed version of OCUnit with no new features.
  * I hate how Xcode Bots doesn&#8217;t have pre and post scripts.
  * I hate (hate is a strong word &#8212; let&#8217;s say disappointed by) the growing community of &#8220;Apple Celebrity&#8221;. The once full time developers who can build great things but now choose to spend the majority of their time blogging, podcasting and tweeting all day. They partake in a low impact ping pong match of opinions on weekly events and news that frankly doesn&#8217;t mean all that much in the grand scheme of things.
