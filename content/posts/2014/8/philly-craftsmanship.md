[Software as Craft Philadelphia][1]

> A community of professionals dedicated to well-crafted software

Was very happy to attend the inaugural meeting of this group last week. Was a great mix of discussion and hands-on coding/pairing. Thanks to [Promptworks][2] for hosting.

During the discussions, the Software Craftsmanship North America conference (as well as its [manifesto][3]) were mentioned. You can find a bunch of the conference videos on the [eighthlight vimeo channel][4]. Seems like pretty interesting stuff.

In related news (since I think all hosts were in attendance at said meeting), I want to give a plug to the podcast [Turing-Incomplete podcast][5]. Finally starting to catch up on this Philly showcase of talent and really enjoying the discussions. Keep up the good work!
