A few days ago I started to archive a lot of the [Clickable Bliss website][1], replacing it with a smaller &#8220;hiatus&#8221; version. In the process I moved the MegaManEffect which lived primarily via a blog post and a GoogleCode subversion repo to GitHub.

<https://github.com/zorn/MegaManEffect>

> The MegaManEffect is an application that emulates an effect seen in the classic NES game Mega Man 2. When you launch a Mac OS X application, the screen goes dark, stars sweep the night sky and your application&#8217;s icon is presented in a blue letter box bar with a cheesy 8-bit music introduction.

> MegaManEffect was written while I attended the ADHOC/MacHack conference in 2004 and took second place in the ADHOC Labs Showcase! In the summer of 2005 the application hit a nerve in the community generating tons of interest and downloads. It is to this day one of the most distributed pieces of code I&#8217;ve even written.

Funny enough after tweeting the move I ended up getting an email and later [a pull request][2] to update the code base to compile on 10.9. I approved the pull request today (thanks [@smithrobs][3]!) with a few other fixes.

The MegaManEffect will be 10 years old this summer.
