description: More details about my freelance and consulting offerings on my For Hire page.

While I know many are struggling with productivity during lock down (and I've certain had some bad days) on the whole I have been able to use the time fairly well. I've been putting major hours into [Guildflow](/projects/guildflow/) (Elixir / Phoenix web development), catching up with WWDC thingsÂ (SwiftUI mostly) as well as kicking off my own [Android Book Club](/posts/2020/6/an-android-book-club-for-ios-developers/). And while these things are great, they are not how I make a living.

I would like to once again remind people I am looking for work. You can see more details about my freelance and consulting offerings on my [For Hire](/for-hire/) page but to summarize, the following types of projects are usually a good match for me:

- Native iOS development
- iOS code review / code auditing
- iOS mentoring / teaching (individuals or teams)
- Elixir / Phoenix web development
- Help setting up continuous integration / deployment systems
- Static website development with Hugo

I do still prefer freelance contracts but am starting to soften on considerations of full time remote offers as well. I appreciate you all keeping an eye out for me. Almost all the work I get is through referrals so it means a lot.
