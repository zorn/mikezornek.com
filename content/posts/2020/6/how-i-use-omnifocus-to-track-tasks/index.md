description: I've been a fan of Getting Things Done and a casual user of OmniFocus for years, mostly focusing on long term projects. For weekly stuff I used to do a manual list in Bear but a few weeks ago I took the time to see if I could make OmniFocus work for my weekly list, and so far it's working out great. This video is a review of what's changed.

[OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) is a task manager that was built around the concepts of [Getting Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done), a popular action management system by David Allen.

For weekly stuff I used to do a manual list in Bear but a few weeks ago I took the time to see if I could make OmniFocus work for my weekly list, and so far it's working out great.

PS: One things I forgot to mention in the video is that for my side project I use [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com) for actionable technical tasks and keep the marketing and general business tasks in OmniFocus. I am also experimenting with a [public project roadmap](https://trello.com/b/Z74hJIPj/clubhouse-roadmap) but that is more experimental.
