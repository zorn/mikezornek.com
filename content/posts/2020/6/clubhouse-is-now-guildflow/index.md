Just a quick note, that I have a new name for my meetup project. Say hello to Guildflow!

> If youâ€™ve been following this project you may have seen some previous names like Campfire and Clubhouse and while I still like those names to run a modern software project requires a lot of unique name checkboxes, registrations and trademarks and those names did not work.
> 
> Why Guildflow? Guild is a nod to the group and community focus of the product and flow is a reference to the zen like toolkit for meetup organizers I envision will continue to materialize as the feature set matures.
