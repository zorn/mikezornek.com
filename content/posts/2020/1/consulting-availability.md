Happy New Year everyone. Hope you enjoyed your break.

Just a quick post today to share that I do have consulting availability and would love to start work on a new client project.

I recently updated my [For Hire](/for-hire/) page but to summarize, the following types of projects are usually a good match for me:

* Native iOS development
* iOS code review / code auditing
* iOS mentoring / teaching (individuals or teams)
* Elixir / Phoenix development
* Help setting up continuous integration / deployment systems
* Static website development with Hugo

Thanks for keeping your ears to the ground and sharing my info when you think it might be a good match.
