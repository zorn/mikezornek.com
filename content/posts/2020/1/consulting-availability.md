Happy New Year everyone. Hope you enjoyed your break.

Just a quick post today to share that I do have consulting availability and would love to start work on a new client project.

I recently updated my [For Hire](/for-hire/) page but to summarize, the following types of projects are usually a good match for me:

- Native iOS development
- iOS code review / code auditing
- iOS mentoring / teaching (individuals or teams)
- Elixir / Phoenix development
- Help setting up continuous integration / deployment systems
- Static website development with Hugo

Thanks for keeping your ears to the ground and sharing my info when you think it might be a good match.
