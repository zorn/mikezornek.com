Once again I missed my weekly updates so today notes include all items since the last check-in, [December 13th](/posts/2020/12/look-back-dec-13/). Additionally, I've been taking it easy during vacation so this list is lighter than usual. 

## [Guildflow](/projects/guildflow/) 

* Got some meaningful work done on group messaging, though still in-progress.
* Spent a good while brainstorming goals for 2021. Will share when they are more concrete.

## [Phoenix by Example](https://twitter.com/PhoenixExamples) 

* Ran two weeks of daily videos / tweets before going on vacation. Really proud of this effort.
* Planning to resume content on January 4th.
* Made a new Twitter avatar/icon.

## Work

* Working with client on plans for 2021, their launch goals and my contract, which atm ends in late February.

## Personal

* Updated the server that runs this site and posted my [Terraform on Linode Notes](/posts/2020/12/terraform-on-linode-notes/)
* Saw the [first snow](https://twitter.com/zorn/status/1339289293177696258) of the year in Philly.
* Started a pretty normal playthrough of Pokemon Soulsilver. Got my first 7 gym badges over break.
* Watched [Fiddler on the Roof](https://twitter.com/zorn/status/1340674617606848516).
