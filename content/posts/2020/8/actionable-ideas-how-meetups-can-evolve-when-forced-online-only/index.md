Today I recorded some thoughts regarding the challenges meetups are facing as they've been forced online and ideas how those challenges can be met.

A quick summery:

- Challenge: Group participation is down.
  - Idea: Embrace the smaller numbers; do things that you could not do with a larger crowd.
  - Idea: Set expectations about required interactions; let people be passive when they want to.
  - Idea: Do more, smaller, focused events instead of one big meeting a month.
  - Idea: Create spaces for socializing outside events.
  - Idea: Help connect people outside your group structure. Make it easy for members to discover each other on social or their personal website.
- Challenge: Hard to attract and retain new members.
  - Idea: Make sure events are structured to help new people get familiar with the community (introductions, one-on-one help, etc.).
  - Idea: Create a chain of events structured around a goal, like a book club or group project.

In some ways, it's a great time to start a meetup:

- No more venue and food costs.
- Can promote and bring in people from outside your city.
- People are out of work and looking to improve themselves, give them a path to do so.

If you want to chat about your own group, I'd love to hear how things are going. See this post for more detail:
