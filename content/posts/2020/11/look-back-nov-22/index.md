Lots of times it's easy to feel bad about missing deadlines but when you add it all up, it turns out a lot of things happened last week. 

I missed last week's update so consider this one a twofer.

## [Guildflow](/projects/guildflow/) 

* Wrote up pitch to define Messaging behaviors and started coding out some things.
* Met with mastermind group. Reviewed recent marketing efforts. Between client work and the US holidays Guildflow is going to be pretty quite through the end of the year.

## Work

* Lots of REDACTED client work in Elixir / Phoenix.
* More reading of [Real-Time Phoenix](https://pragprog.com/titles/sbsockets/real-time-phoenix/).
* Started reading [Domain-Driven Design](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/179133.Domain_Driven_Design). I started reading this one years ago, but never finished it. It's come up again as we are trying to work out some code growth issues. This talk ([Building beautiful systems with Phoenix contexts... by Andrew Hao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3VgbSgo71E)) also came up and was interesting.
* Attended the Philly CocoaHead Side Project Saturday meeting. Talked about [lots of stuff](https://twitter.com/phillycocoa/status/1330268836453552129).

## Personal

* Car inspection and oil change.
* Added new [Follow](/follow) page to this website. 
* Did some looking for [a new apartment](https://twitter.com/zorn/status/1328181090012553217).
* Jumped by into my re-watch of [Firefly](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303461/).
