description: Most quality iOS apps cost between $100,000 to $1,000,000 to build. Some apps will be less and some more. If you're looking for an app built with great design, superior development, and clever marketing though, it will be somewhere in that range.

As I take prospective client calls, particularly for those clients looking to build a new iOS app from scratch, the big question ultimately is raised:

> How much does it cost to build an iOS app?

I think [Ken Yarmosh's summary](https://savvyapps.com/blog/how-much-does-app-cost-massive-review-pricing-budget-considerations) hits the nail on the head:

> ... most quality apps cost between $100,000 to $1,000,000. Some apps will be less and some more. If you're looking for an app built with great design, superior development, and clever marketing though, it will be somewhere in that range.

I highly encourage you to read that article to learn more. You should also check out [The Nature of Software Development by Ron Jeffries](https://pragprog.com/book/rjnsd/the-nature-of-software-development) which is a great, short and visual book on the topic (not specifically of costs, but of quality project development practices).

I'll also share my own notes, which I captured today in [MindNode](https://mindnode.com/) to help me through these phone calls.

The notes are published below in a few open formats. Hopefully this helps. If you have any questions or want to talk about your own project, please [contact me](/contact/). Thanks!
