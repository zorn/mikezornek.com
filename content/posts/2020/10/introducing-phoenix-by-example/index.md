Teaching has always been a big part of my self identity. Be it teaching at university, Big Nerd Ranch workshops or even my work with local tech meetups.

With my increasing enjoyment of [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) and [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) I've been anxious to find a teaching outlet using these technologies. Additionally I want to find a unique spin on whatever I come up with, since there are already lots of great resources for [learning Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/learning.html) and [Phoenix](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/community.html) and I don't want steal anyone's thunder.

My first result towards this effort is a "hello world" style example app and tutorial called [greeter](https://github.com/phoenix-by-example/greeter):

> Greeter is a "hello world" example app to help introduce the core concepts of the Phoenix Framework written in Elixir.
>
> This tutorial assumes no previous Elixir experience. In fact the first section will help you install and setup Elixir and Phoenix.
>
> By the end of this example, you'll have created a Phoenix app that can display a custom greeting message with a formatted name.

I've published the example repo under the Phoenix by Example organization name. I've also nabbed a web domain `phoenixbyexample.com` and a twitter account `@PhoenixExamples`.

I'm still not sure how this will work out over time but my plan is to record a few videos to accompany the example project. I would also like to work out some shorter tweet videos with some tips and tricks content.

The next project I'm thinking about would be a link shortener. I suspect I will not do a step-by-step tutorial for that one, but instead lean on code snippets pointing out the big ideas and then more videos.

The only really "bad news" is that I have a new Elixir Phoenix client project starting up so progress on these examples will be a little slower than I expected when I started pulling it together.

Feedback and project ideas very welcome. [Let me know](/contact) what you think.
