Lots of times it's easy to feel bad about missing deadlines but when you add it all up, it turns out a lot of things happened last week. 

## [Guildflow](https://guildflow.com/) 

* Got my pull request that adds Postmark broadcast email support to the Elixir swoosh library was merged in! [More info.](http://mikezornek.com/posts/2020/10/postmark-broadcast-via-elixir-swoosh/) 
* Worked on a per-event Add to Calendar feature that lets you download an `.ics` file or create a new event in Google Calendar via a customize link. This was a feature request of a beta user so happy to see user needs starting to dictate feature development!
* Started my official campaign with [EthicalAds](https://www.ethicalads.io/), which is a privacy-focused advertising network for developers from the folks at Read the Docs. I ended up tweaking the ad copy to hopefully improve the click through rate. I'll share result in a few weeks.
* Did a demo of Guildflow for [IndyHall](https://www.indyhall.org) Show and Tell. 
* Improved the loading time of the new home page by optimizing lots of images.

## Work

* For the Android Book Club I read chapters: 24 HTTP and Background Tasks, 25 Loopers, Handlers, and HandlerThread, and 26 SearchView and SharedPreferences. I normally code these in too but did not do it this week as I had some other higher priorities.
* Met with Kotaro to review progress on his iPad drawing app and share my own progress with Guildflow.
* Finalized details for a new client project. Will be helping a team using Elixir and Phoenix for a large website relaunch.
* Finished up my [hello world greeter example Phoenix project](https://github.com/phoenix-by-example/greeter) and tutorial. Need to promote it this week. 
* Did a Remote User Testing Session for a customer. [They loved it.](https://twitter.com/zorn/status/1315734094505013250)

## Personal

* [Finished](https://twitter.com/zorn/status/1317838447151882246) my play through of Final Fantasy 4j (rom hack version). 
* [SOCKPOCOLYPSE](https://twitter.com/zorn/status/1317522535383183361)
* Started a playthrough of Majora's Mask on 3DS. [Was Majora's Mask 3D a Bad Remake?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=653wuaP0wzs)
