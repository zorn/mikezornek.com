Lots of times it's easy to feel bad about missing deadlines but when you add it all up, it turns out a lot of things happened last week. 

## [Guildflow](https://guildflow.com/) 

* Worked on some limited podcast marketing experiments.
* Started work on website update that would offer the screenshots in a gallery UI.
* Took a meeting with a community manager of a technology company and learned a ton about the needs of a person who helps lots of meetups promote that tech.
* Finished reading [Get Together](https://gettogether.world/).

## Work

* Started a new full time client project, where I get to help out with a large Elixir / Phoenix project.
* During the onboarding for said client project, got to learn about [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com) a tool to manage multiple runtime versions with a single CLI tool. I have mixed feeling about it vs a Docker setup but trying to give it a fair shake.
* For the Android Book Club I read chapter 27 WorkManager and chapter 28 Broadcast Intents.
* Started reading [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) which is a project process from the folks at Basecamp.
* Caught up with my two mastermind groups.
* Promoted my first [Phoenix by Example stuff on Twitter](https://twitter.com/PhoenixExamples/status/1318336113916940288).

## Personal

* [I voted!](https://twitter.com/zorn/status/1320105967338532865)
* More progress on my Majora's Mask 3DS playthrough.
