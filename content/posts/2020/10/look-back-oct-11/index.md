Lots of times it's easy to feel bad about missing deadlines but when you add it all up, it turns out a lot of things happened last week. 

## [Guildflow](/projects/guildflow/) 

* Launched the [big marketing landing page update](/projects/guildflow/) with lots of new screenshots to tempt people to join the beta and upgrade their own meetups.
* Worked on a fork of swoosh (an Elixir email library). Specifically [my fork updates the Postmark adaptor](https://github.com/Guildflow/swoosh/commits/postmark-updates) so I can batch and send broadcast email with a custom message stream. Hope to post an official pull request and demo video soonâ„¢. Eventually Guildflow will use this adaptor to help group admins send broadcast messages (with email notifications) to the memberships at large.
* Started some experiments with [EthicalAds](https://www.ethicalads.io/), which is a privacy-focused advertising network for developers from the folks at Read the Docs. The admin team there is very helpful and I hope this works out.

## Work

* For the Android Book Club I read and coded chapters: 21 (Styles and Theme), 22 (XML Drawables), 23 (More About Intents and Tasks).
* Met with Kotaro to review progress on his iPad drawing app and share my own progress with Guildflow.
* Cleaned up a lot of loose end todos and digital trash.
* Started work on some Elixir tutorials. Will share more when they are ready.
* Took delivery of a new Intel NUC which for now is running [Pop_os!](https://pop.system76.com/).

## Personal

* Continued my play through of Final Fantasy 4j (rom hack version). Deep into the final dungeon. Probably only one more gaming session left.
* Played a mix of Mario 64 Switch, Hades and Red Dead 2. 
* Hit [a wall](/posts/2020/10/airpods-pro-repair/) trying to get my AirPods fixed.
