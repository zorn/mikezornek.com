👨‍💻 Right now I'm on a client project that has me working on an iOS SDK codebase but still touching GoLang, C and Kotlin/Android as well. I'm doing the best I can but it is challenging jumping around, particularly into languages I don't have a rich history with. 

This experience does however back up my opinion that good programers are better off being proficient in many languages.

If you do find yourself with some extra time indoors over the next few weeks, consider giving yourself a distraction and try to learn something new. I recommend [Exercism](https://exercism.io) as a great starting point for many different languages. They even have mentors to help. I also like [PragProg's "Seven (Things) in Seven Weeks" series](https://pragprog.com/titles?f[sort_by]=pubdate&f[category]=all&f[skill_level]=All&f[title_contains]=seven).

Good luck out there. Stay safe, stay sane. Make today count!
