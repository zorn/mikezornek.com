Just a quick post today to share that my current client project will end April 1st and I'll have consulting availability opening up.

For more info you can check out my [For Hire](http://mikezornek.com/for-hire/) page but to summarize, the following types of projects are usually a good match for me:

- Native iOS development
- iOS code review / code auditing
- iOS mentoring / teaching (individuals or teams)
- Elixir / Phoenix development
- Help setting up continuous integration / deployment systems
- Static website development with Hugo

Thanks for keeping your ears to the ground and sharing my info when you think it might be a good match.
