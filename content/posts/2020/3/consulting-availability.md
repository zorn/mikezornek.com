Just a quick post today to share that my current client project will end April 1st and I'll have consulting availability opening up.

For more info you can check out my [For Hire](http://mikezornek.com/for-hire/) page but to summarize, the following types of projects are usually a good match for me:

* Native iOS development
* iOS code review / code auditing
* iOS mentoring / teaching (individuals or teams)
* Elixir / Phoenix development
* Help setting up continuous integration / deployment systems
* Static website development with Hugo

Thanks for keeping your ears to the ground and sharing my info when you think it might be a good match.
