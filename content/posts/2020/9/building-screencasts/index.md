I'm a big fan of screencasts. I generalize the term screencast here as any video where you see primarily a computer or user interface, with a voice and optional video feed of a person doing some kind of demonstration. 

You've seen lots of screencasts here on the blog and I've even done a few professionally as a consultant, using real voice-over performers.

In today's video I'll recount how I built the recent [70-second introduction video for Guildflow](https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/mikezornek-com-media/an_introduction_to_guildflow_own_your_meetup.mp4) with specific demos and discussions of the tools I use including:

* [Bear](https://bear.app/) to write a screenplay in Markdown.
* [Keynote](https://www.apple.com/keynote/) to build a presentation of screenshots.
* [Screenflow](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow) to record my desktop and edit the capture.
* QuickTime and [Acorn](https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/) to build thumbnails.
