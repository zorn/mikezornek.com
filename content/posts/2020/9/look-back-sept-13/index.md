Lots of times it's easy to feel bad about missing deadlines but when you add it all up, it turns out a lot of things happened last week. 

## [Guildflow](https://guildflow.com/) 

* Pushed out a new build (see the [CHANGELOG](https://guildflow.com/changelog/)). Mostly bug fixes and security updates. Also re-added the ability to grant the admin role to other members. One big feature was close but not ready. Maybe next week.
* Made some good progress on a new feature allowing custom pages and an editable navigation. Didn't make this week's deployment but looking good locally.
* Started [documenting](https://github.com/Guildflow/guildflow-marketing-website/issues/46) the new focus on technical meetups.

## Work

* Recorded a [Remote User Testing Session](/user-testing/) for an iOS to Mac remote app. Client was [very happy](https://twitter.com/cherpake/status/1303221828928843776) with how it turned out.
* Took two meetings to discuss new work opportunities, one iOS and the other Elixir.
* Worked on a project proposal for the iOS lead.
* Attended two separate Mastermind meetings.
* Had to postpone my Elixir meetup due to a family emergency. Have [rescheduled it](https://phillyelixir.guildflow.com/events/273173863/) for 2 weeks later.
* Attended [Philly CocoaHeads social hour](https://www.meetup.com/PhillyCocoaHeads/events/272969673/).
* Got in a second writing session for the [meetup book](https://github.com/Guildflow/technical-meetup-book). Need to do better about making time for this.
* Prepared September Tax Estimate payments. Will mail out tomorrow.
* Attended weekly Android Book Club and [reviewed ConstraintLayout and the Room database library](https://androidbookclub.guildflow.com/events/10).
* [Started](https://twitter.com/zorn/status/1303813465354760192) a monthly donation to the [Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/).

## Personal

* Helped a friend with some project research.
* Ended up sadly canceling my YMCA membership since I could never get a lap swim reservation under the new rules. Hope to revisit this when it is too cold to walk in the morning.
* Attended [IndyHall](https://www.indyhall.org) Town Hall.
* Attended [IndyHall](https://www.indyhall.org) Show and Tell.
