Lots of times it's easy to feel bad about missing deadlines but when you add it all up, it turns out a lot of things happened last week. 

## [Guildflow](/projects/guildflow/) 

* Finally finished the new page and editable navigation feature. 
* Deployed version 0.11, which includes the above features and some minor fixes.
* Updated the Changelog on the marketing site.
* Posted a pair of short feature demos. One on [How to Create a New Group](https://vimeo.com/461057012) and the other [How to Add Members via Membership Applications](https://vimeo.com/461060940).
* Posted a new blog post: [Goal-oriented Side Event Ideas for Technical Meetups](/posts/2020/9/goal-oriented-side-event-ideas/).
* Started work on a bigger marketing site update. Not sure when it will launch, but I want to feature those feature demos above.

## Work

* For the Android Book Club I read chapter 18 (Accessibility). I have not yet coded this weeks chapters (16, 17 and 18) but hope to do so on Monday before the meeting.
* I did however get deep into some [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) tutorials and experiments.
* Attended the Philly CocoaHeads Side Project Saturday event.
* Did a two hour pairing session using Elixir for a prospective subcontractor role.
* Did a pair of mastermind related meetings.
* Met with Kotaro to review progress on his iPad drawing app and share my own progress with Guildflow.
* Attended an IndyHall show and tell which included member onboarding improvements and voting info.
* Hosted the rescheduled September meeting of Philly Elixir and talked a lot about [LiveView](https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/build-a-real-time-twitter-clone-in-15-minutes-with-live-view-and-phoenix-1-5) use in Guildflow.

## Personal

* Continued my play through of Final Fantasy 4j (rom hack version). About to go to the moon for those who know that game.
* Had to request a return of Mario 3D All Stars from Amazon (it never showed) and instead ordered a copy from Target.
* Had a social coffee with a friend. Trying to set these up with people I'd normally run into downtown but have not seen in months due to lock down.
