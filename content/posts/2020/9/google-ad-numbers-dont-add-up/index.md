I tried to run some Google Ads but can't reconcile the numbers. I've been duped!

**Video Notes**

- [I work as a consultant.](http://mikezornek.com/for-hire/)
  - I do a lot of iOS development, some Elixir, some teaching, etc.
- Trying out a new productized service angle:
  - [Developer-focused User Reviews for $99](http://mikezornek.com/user-testing/)
  - Spent about a day working on a landing page and demo video.
- Marketing so far: Release-day social post and the blog header.
- Figured I'd try some Google Ads.
- Initial take on the Google Ad UI: Much better for a person starting out.
- Ran my ads for about a week.
- The numbers don't ad up in my eyes.
  - I paid Google for 222 clicks but can only reconcile 77 of them.
  - I asked for delivery to United States only and they did not seem to honor that.
- Turned off the ad campaign for now.
