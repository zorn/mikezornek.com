Lots of times it's easy to feel bad about missing deadlines but when you add it all up, it turns out a lot of things happened last week.

## [Guildflow](/projects/guildflow/)

- Posted [a draft of the terms of service](https://github.com/Guildflow/policy/blob/main/terms-of-service.md) for feedback.
- Made and [shared progress](https://twitter.com/guildflow/status/1306409113371455491) on the editable navigation but ran into some UI / Framework issues that are going to cause me to rethink how I design the UI.
- Posted a video story about why I built Guildflow.
- Updated the website to use Fathom Analytics, which does not use cookies, and thus [helps me avoid obnoxious cookie agreement banners](https://twitter.com/guildflow/status/1305974016763727873).
- Posted a [2 minute demo of how Group Export works](https://twitter.com/guildflow/status/1305603188758900736).

## Work

- Did an adhoc unit testing Q&A with fellow CocoaHead Kenny. Probably going to [do some more at the upcoming Side Project Saturday](https://twitter.com/zorn/status/1308065828470915072).
- Did my main Android Book Club homework, chapters 14 and 15 coded, and through chapter 17 read.
- Did some extra Android Book Club homework, learning about Kotlin Coroutines.
- Watch the Apple Event. Not a watch user myself and not in the market for a new iPad, but some interesting things.
- Did a first call with a client prospect.
- Submitted a client proposal document that was mostly done last week.
- Met with Kotaro and reviewed each other's project progress.

## Personal

- Saw my doctor for my annual physical. Making good progress on my weight loss, still have a lot to go.
- Continued my play through of Final Fantasy 4j (rom hack version). [Discovered the developer's room](https://twitter.com/zorn/status/1307858059948109825) after 29 years!
- My Mario 3D All Stars [hasn't shipped yet](https://twitter.com/zorn/status/1307096655313940483) but hope to play it soon.
- [Got a new keyboard!](https://twitter.com/zorn/status/1305962634978656258) Old one had a broken left arrow key.
- Got some new sweatpants! My morning walks were getting very cold these past few weeks.
