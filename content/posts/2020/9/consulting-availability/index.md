I would like to once again remind people I am looking for work. You can see more details about my freelance and consulting offerings on my [For Hire](/for-hire/) page but to summarize, the following types of projects are usually a good match for me:

* Elixir / Phoenix web development
* Native iOS development
* iOS code review / code auditing
* iOS mentoring / teaching (individuals or teams)
* Help setting up continuous integration / deployment systems
* Static website development with Hugo

I do still prefer freelance contracts but am starting to soften on considerations of full time remote offers as well. 

I appreciate you all keeping an eye out for me. Almost all the work I get is through referrals so your help means a lot.
