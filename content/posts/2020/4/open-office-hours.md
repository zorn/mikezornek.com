Yesterday was my last day on contract and once again I have [Consulting Availability](http://mikezornek.com/posts/2020/3/consulting-availability/) and am available [for hire](http://mikezornek.com/for-hire/).

With some time to kill I'm looking forward to catching up on some personal projects but today I wanted to share my **Open Office Hours**.

If you'd like a free, casual consultation about your project or code issues please [schedule an online meeting](https://calendly.com/zorn/open-meeting). Slots are 1 hour in length and recommend topics would include:

* iOS / Swift Questions
* Phoenix / Ecto / Elixir Questions
* Testing Help
* Continuous Integration Setup
* HTML / CSS
* Static website development with Hugo
* Public Speaking / Technical Presentations / Teaching
