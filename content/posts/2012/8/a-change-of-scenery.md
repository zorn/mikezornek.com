After considering my options over the past few weeks, I made the move this past Sunday. It was another long Sunday night working at [IndyHall][1], and as I finished my work, I proceeded to pack up my iMac and all of its various wires. For the next few weeks I was going to work from home.

To be clear, this move has nothing to do with IndyHall, the workspace, or the community. It’s more of personal problem. I’ve done a poor job balancing my work time, my investment time, and my personal time.

I’ve been working at IndyHall full-time for almost two years. The best times for me mentally were when I had a single project on which to focus. I would work 4 days a week, usually from 11:00 am til 7:00 pm and then spend Friday working from home, throwing in laundry in between Xcode indexing stints.

These days I have two main projects. One is a consulting gig with an ever-approaching release date. The other is [Shindig][2], which is a startup I joined over a year ago. It has similar big ship dates on the horizon. I also have my own company &#8212; Clickable Bliss, which has it’s own customer support needs. Plus, I have an ongoing update to my invoicing product, which has been on hold ever since I started working on Shindig.

Over the last three months, I’ve been spending 6 days a week at IndyHall, many until late at night. It’s become very draining and stressful.

This week is my first week back at home. I’ll go into IndyHall on Thursday to pick up my new MacBook Air and to conduct PhillyCocoa Office Hours, but otherwise it’s back to coding in the bedroom. I don’t have any major goals with this change but I do want to see where it takes me. Previously, I would avoid working from home, especially since doing so can lead to easy distractions and longer lunches. These days, however, I think I need a little of that.

For now, I think I’ll close this up and grab my swim trunks for a few laps at the gym &#8212; another thing that’s been off my schedule for too long.
