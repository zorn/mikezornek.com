I miss blogging. For a while it was a major way I interacted with the community, shared my thoughts, and met new people.

I vaguely remember shutting down this site down in favor of putting my full attention behind [Clickable Bliss][1] and its own blog. For a while this worked fine. I limited my blogging to tech things and was legitimately spending most of my time on Clickable Bliss. These days, I find myself splitting my time between [Shindig][2] and consulting. I still play video games and would love to work on a real RPG to call my own someday. I want to blog about these things but find the Clickable Bliss focus limiting or inappropriate.

This is a fresh start. A new beginning.
