Had too much fun asking ChatGPT to generate haiku poems and rap songs about programming tools and languages. Here is one about Elixir.

## Compose a rap song about how much programmers love the functional programming language Elixir.

Verse 1:  
Listen up y'all, let me tell you 'bout a language that's dope  
It's called Elixir, and it's more than just a little bit of hope  
It's functional programming, and it's built to scale  
You can build web apps, IoT, and anything else you wanna unveil

Chorus:  
Elixir, Elixir, it's the language of the gods  
Programmers love it, they're never gonna stop  
With its easy syntax and its powerful tools  
Elixir's the one that rules, yeah, Elixir's the one that rules

Verse 2:  
Elixir's got it all, from concurrency to fault tolerance  
And the syntax is so sweet, you'll never want to go back to nonsense  
It's got pipes, macros, and pattern matching too  
Elixir's so efficient, it's gonna make your code dreams come true  

Chorus:  
Elixir, Elixir, it's the language of the gods  
Programmers love it, they're never gonna stop  
With its easy syntax and its powerful tools  
Elixir's the one that rules, yeah, Elixir's the one that rules

Verse 3:  
So if you want to build something that's fast and robust  
Elixir's the language that you can trust  
You can build real-time apps and scale with ease  
Elixir's the future, it's the one that's gonna please

Chorus:  
Elixir, Elixir, it's the language of the gods  
Programmers love it, they're never gonna stop  
With its easy syntax and its powerful tools  
Elixir's the one that rules, yeah, Elixir's the one that rules

Outro:  
So now you know why programmers love Elixir so much  
It's the language that's got the perfect touch  
If you're not using it yet, you're missing out  
Elixir's the future, it's what programming's all about.
