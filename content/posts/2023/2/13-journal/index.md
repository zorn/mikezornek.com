Monday, February 13, 2023 -- The only consistent thing in this world is change.

## Work

Last time I posted a journal entry with news that I had started a new contract gig, but I'm disappointed to share that it did not work out. There was some interesting tech within the project that I was (still am) interested in getting more production time with (GraphQL/Relay), but there was a lot of misalignment for how I prefer to work. It resulted in some stressful days and missed expectations on both sides. After some deep consideration, I decided to give my notice in favor of looking for something else.

I'll post more details on what kind of Elixir gig I will be looking for, but I wanted to share this first since it is a notable adjustment from my last journal post.

## ElixirClub

ElixirClub has been quieter that I would prefer over the last two weeks. With my newly found free time, I plan to invest in some content creation and try to reach out to the current members to see what else I can do to help them move their projects forward. Maybe even some 1:1 pairing time.

## Hobbies

Out of the blue I played Stardew Valley on Thursday night. It was a lot of fun. Played my 3+ year farm doing end-game things. I suspect I'll play some more in the coming weeks.

For TV, I finished my long-running watch of Deep Space Nine, which was great. Soon after I started up season one of Voyager (which is mostly new to me as well). Also started cherry-picking some more notable episodes out of Quantum Leap instead of watching it fully through. Anxious to get to evil leaper and the JFK episodes.

I watched the Super Bowl last night and am bummed for the Eagles and my city. I'm not a huge football fan, but the city is for sure, so a big bummer.

On the flip side, baseball is just around the corner, and I can't wait. Pitchers and catchers have their first workout this Thursday, and some spring training games start February 25th.

Related, I'm pumped for MLB: The Show 2023. It was greate to see [The Negro Leagues feature](https://theshow.com/news/mlb-the-show-23-introduces-a-new-game-experience-storylines-the-negro-leagues-season-1/) too -- that was something I explicitly asked for last year.
