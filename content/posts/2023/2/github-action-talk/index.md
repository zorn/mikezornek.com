I'm going to be doing a talk about GitHub Actions for ElixirClub: [Creating Your First Elixir/Phoenix CI Check with GitHub Actions](https://www.elixirclub.org/c/topic-events/github-actions. 

The talk is free and open to the public. RSVP and join us on Zoom Wednesday, March 8th from 7:00 PM to 08:00 PM (EST).

> This talk is for people curious about the basics of GitHub Actions and how they can utilize this automation tool to better verify code changes within their Elixir projects. The event will consist of a lecture, live audience exercises on GitHub, and close with time for questions.
> 
> [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) enables you to build custom automations right within your GitHub repo. These automations can be used for Continuous Integration checks (verifying the app builds with no warnings, all the tests pass, etc), Continuous Deployment (package your app for release, execute the release, etc.), and many other creative workflows. The service is free for public repos and has a generous allocation for free-account private repos.
