Monday, September 11, 2023 -- A regular check-in of personal things.

## Work

Work has been relatively busy. 

My one client, who is in a maintenance-type contract, had multiple downtime issues recently. I was able to deal with the Elixir incident personally but was more on the sidelines for an Android build issue.

For my other part-time client, I continue to hack on API consumption tasks (about 10 hours a week), with a recent focus on Microsoft Graph and Slack. One nugget of good news is that I am now working in the main parent repo instead of an isolated one, making some things more manageable. In addition to my active API work, I'd like to spend a little time helping them evolve their CI/CD and production observability, but we'll see.

I still need more hours. I spent some time reaching out to some prospects but still waiting for solid leads.

## Side Projects

Posted two new blog posts on Course Dreamers since my last journal entry, [How to Keep Student Attention During an Online Course](https://coursedreamers.com/posts/2023/8/15/keeping-student-attention/) and [Your Course Needs Regular, Interactive Feedback Loops To Keep Students Out of Tutorial Hell](https://coursedreamers.com/posts/2023/8/30/interactive-feedback-and-tutorial-hell/), but not hitting the content goals I have for myself. I should post one article a week and a few other links.

I finished up my experiment projects with [Ash](https://github.com/zorn/helpdesk-elixir-api) and [Svelte](https://github.com/zorn/helpdesk-svelte). I also posted a few YouTube videos talking about them: [Early thoughts on using Ash Framework to produce a GraphQL API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeMuXWrRq80) and [Reviewing my decision to try Svelte/SvelteKit over LiveView for StudyHall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZh8j73K0vM).

With those experiments done, I kicked off my new project, StudyHall. I describe StudyHall with:

> Goal: To create open-source software and an accessible platform that allows people to teach the art of programming. 

It's all vague as I'm still in the research phase. You can check out the [main project repo](https://github.com/studyhall-project/studyhall) and [project board](https://github.com/orgs/studyhall-project/projects/1). I am working on some tech things, but I plan to spend most of my upcoming time on wireframing and brainstorming ideas.

I also bought a new microphone, hoping to do some podcasting for Course Dreamers.

## Tech Education / Books

To help my currently soft JavaScript skills, I finished working through the Fireship [Modern JavaScript Course](https://fireship.io/courses/js/) and am working through the Exercism JavaScript track and [recording myself](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcuknvxBZ9L4ap08kaE4MLqu1YUs5ipTt) doing it. I also want to do something with TypeScript, but I don't know what resources I'll use.

I started the [VS Code Magic Tricks Course](https://fireship.io/courses/vscode-tricks/) on Fireship a few weeks ago but have yet to make much progress recently. I want to give it some more of my time and finish soon.

I finished reading [Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software](https://press.stripe.com/working-in-public) and [posted a new review](https://jawns.club/@zorn/110979009585293406).

I finished reading [The SaaS Playbook: Build a Multimillion-Dollar Startup Without Venture Capital](https://saasplaybook.com/) and [posted a review](https://jawns.club/@zorn/110895149573327256).

I finished listening to the audiobook Upgrade by Blake Crouch and [posted a review](https://jawns.club/@zorn/110973392354407337).

Currently reading:

* [Wireframing for Everyone](https://abookapart.com/products/wireframing-for-everyone) - to help me get into a good drawing mindset as I explore some courseware UI ideas.
* [Genetic Algorithms in Elixir](https://pragprog.com/titles/smgaelixir/genetic-algorithms-in-elixir/) as part of [Elixir Book Club](https://elixirbookclub.github.io/website//).
* [Will It Fly?: How to Test Your Next Business Idea So You Don't Waste Your Time and Money](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28678036-will-it-fly) - an old audiobook I bought a while ago and thought I'd check it out. It's ok but pretty introductory so far.

You can [follow me on GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30324035-mike-zornek) for more book progress (though I am considering other options).

## Phillies

I'm excited for the last few weeks and the start of the playoffs. The wild card feels solid, but we need to finish strong. I have been going to a bunch of games. I will be at tomorrow's Braves game with my sister and maybe the Mets next week.

## Video Games

I'm not playing MLB: The Show as much. Maybe I just needed a break.

Casually playing Read Dead 2, and Stardew Valley on some nights, but nothing too crazy. I ordered the Red Dead 1 PS4 port and will likely play it after my current playthrough of Red Dead 2.

## Walks and Exercise

I am doing better and have been walking a few days a week. I hope to start to mix in some other activities like swimming and basketball soon. I also need to follow up with better eating, but happy to make some progress.

***

That was a lot of stuff. Once again, I am reminded I should do this more often.
