Monday, October 20, 2023 -- It's been over a month since I did a casual journal -- so here we go.

## Work

Work has been good. Still in an underemployed amount of client work phase, but working more hours this month than last, so I'll take that as good news.

For my main client, I've been focusing on API consumption-related features, getting our Microsoft features out into production, and getting started on some Slack logic.

I still hope to land more hours and will start promoting again soon.

## Side Projects

Course Dreamers blog has been quiet. There was a post on September 22, [Your Student Finished the Course; Now What?](https://coursedreamers.com/posts/2023/9/22/celebrating-student-success/), but nowhere near the weekly goals I originally was shooting for.

StudyHall has gotten most of my attention in recent weeks. You can check out [the completed items on the project board](https://github.com/orgs/studyhall-project/projects/1/views/3) or [raw commits](https://github.com/studyhall-project/studyhall/commits/main) for an overview. I also recorded a YouTube review of [October progress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5HM6cOoTBI).

My recorded work through the [Exercism JavaScript track](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcuknvxBZ9L4ap08kaE4MLqu1YUs5ipTt) has slowed, but did see a few videos recently. I hope to jump back in soon.

While I fell short in some goals, I feel good about my limited progress.

## Tech Education / Books

Still reading [Wireframing for Everyone](https://abookapart.com/products/wireframing-for-everyone) (almost done), [Genetic Algorithms in Elixir](https://pragprog.com/titles/smgaelixir/genetic-algorithms-in-elixir/) (half-way done, and keeping up with the book club), and have also recently started [Observability Engineering: Achieving Production Excellence](https://info.honeycomb.io/observability-engineering-oreilly-book-2022). Alongside that book, I also worked through some [Honeycomb tutorials](https://www.honeycomb.io/usecase/learn-honeycomb).

You can [follow me on GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30324035-mike-zornek) for more book progress (though I am considering other options).

## Phillies

The Phillies have been doing great in the postseason. Each game is a significant energy investment but well worth it. Tonight is game 4 of the NLCS.

## Video Games

Working through a playthrough of Red Dead 2 (mainly focusing on the story, though I did upgrade most of the camp options). I'm also playing  Majora's Mask on the 3DS (which curiously feels like a fall game for me). 

Next up: Red Dead 1 PS4 port, Mario Wonder, Mario RPG remake, and Sea of Stars.

## Walks and Exercise

Doing a little better. Walking a bit and also playing with Ring Fit Adventure on Switch. Not sure I'll keep up on that one. I've found the leg strap hard to keep in place and very distracting. Still, as the cold weather continues to mount, I will need some kind of indoor cardio.

That's it for now. Thanks for reading and your interest.
