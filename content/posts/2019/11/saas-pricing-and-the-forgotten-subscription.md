Here is a question I would LOVE to get current SaaS owners to answer:

How much of your revenue is from "forgotten subscriptions"? Those users who signed, paid (sometimes continously)

As I start to consider pricing models for my own SaaS (Club House Hosting) I keep coming back to a thought I had long ago.

Raise your hand if you've ever discovered a content or service subscription you were paying for but were not utilizing.

I suspect most if not all of my more techy reader base just

The Forgotten Subscription is the dirty secret most SaaS owners don't want to talk about and I wonder how much

If I had a monthly subscription for educational videos, and you noticed I hadn't watched any in a month it would SO cool if you charged me like half the normal rate or something.

So many companies are profiting off of "forgotten subscriptions" I feel like this is the least the industry can do.
