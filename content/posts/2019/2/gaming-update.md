First and foremost I've been playing [Civilization VI](https://store.steampowered.com/app/289070/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VI/), and getting better too. Civilization VI is by far one of the most complex games I've ever played (this is my first game in the series) but its been fun learning the game mechanics. I've been nudging up the AI difficulty as I go and it's starting to get rather challenging, though like many I do wish the AI was smarter rather than just more rewarded in order to draw its advantages.

This week we will see a new expansion for Civilization VI, Gathering Storm, which will add lots more environmental issues (global warming, volcanos, river floods) amongst other additions and changes. Related to the release, there is a Steam sale for the core game plus all previous DLC for 70% off, $40 total. If you've been on the fence about trying Civilization VI now is a great time to check it out. I do recommend trying the base game before getting the new DLC to make sure you like the game format first. If you do jump in, let me know and we can play online together.

In Civilization VI downtime I'm on a bit of a Final Fantasy kick. I'm playing the Final Fantasy X HD remake for PS4 and Final Fantasy XIV (MMO) for PC. I've had the HD remake sitting around since when I bought the PS4 and playing it is part of my general goal to explore more of my backlog before buying new games.

As for FF XIV, well I need my MMO fix since I've turned off WoW. I'm not putting in crazy hours or anything. I'm taking things slow and steady, exploring the game and its many, many job choices. I really like the crafting system so far. It is so much deeper than WoW's crafting and I like how I can level all the jobs on one character.

That's it for now. Keep on gaming!
