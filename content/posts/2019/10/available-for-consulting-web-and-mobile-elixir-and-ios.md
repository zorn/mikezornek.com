A few planned consulting projects have been postponed and I now have some consulting availability headed into November/December. If you could use some help with an Elixir or iOS project, let's chat.

I am very comfortable working remotely with on-site travel for big project milestones.

I am also up for some teaching / mentoring work for any junior developers out there. I love helping solo projects and teams improve process, introduce automation and other good practices.

Most of the work I get is from word of mouth so please consider sharing in your own social circles. Thanks!!
