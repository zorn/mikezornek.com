Overall 2018 was a pretty good year.

## The Good:

* 2018 marked the first full year of my self-employment comeback.
* I was able to maintain billable client projects the entire year.
* After having a few down productive months, decided to [rejoin IndyHall](http://mikezornek.com/posts/2018/7/back-to-full-time-at-indyhall/) as a full time member in July. It's a bit costly (I pay extra for parking too), but this has helped me focus, both on client work and personal projects.
* [Attended WWDC](http://mikezornek.com/posts/2018/6/wwdc-2018-social-recap/) and had some social fun.
* [Attended ElixirConf](http://mikezornek.com/posts/2018/9/elixirconf-2018-notes/) and doubled down on my excitement for this language, community and ecosystem.
* Finished my handoff of Philly CocoaHeads admin duties (still active member), giving me more time for new things.
* Continued to expand my web education.
* Paid off some long time debits.
* Started a savings account for a possible house down payment.

## The Bad:

* Many of my recent side projects have died on the vine. Lots of false starts. I'm not shipping like I want to. 
* Most of my consulting income comes from one large client. Need to diversify.

## 2019 Goals

* Diversify and increase my income.
	* Add more clients so less dependent on single large client.
	* Add passive income through a new product/service.
	* Shoot for a 10% income increase.
* Be better at shipping/executing.
	* 2017 & 2018 was a lot of learning new tech, demo projects.
	* 2019 needs to be about shipping real value.
* Do a better job of tracking my time.
	* 20-30 client hours/week
	* 20-30 project hours/week
	* 50 total "work" hours/week
* Better code documentation.
* Utilize work byproducts as education / blog opportunities.
