Just took advantage of the early bird pricing for [Emerging Technologies for the Enterprise 2019](https://2019.phillyemergingtech.com/) and got registered.

> Entering its 12th year, the Emerging Technologies Conference has brought the leaders of the open source community to Philadelphia to teach about their projects, their work and how these technologies are changing software development. During this time, ETE has become one of the largest gatherings of developers in the mid-Atlantic.

I've been to ETE in the past and particularly like how it lets me sample lots of topics I don't see in my traditional iOS circles. Lots of local tech friends usually show up so it's a great way to say hi and meet people too.
