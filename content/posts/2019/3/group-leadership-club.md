Today I'd like to share a new project I've been working on called [Group Leadership Club](http://groupleadership.club/), Helping People Build Successful Technical Meetups.

> This site is dedicated to group leaders. Our goal is to help them start, run and sustain their own meetup groups. Through articles and a community forum we work to answer questions and provide guidance.

I'm a huge believer in the power of meetup groups. I've participated in many groups over the years and have myself helped run a very successful group in [Philly CocoaHeads](http://phillycocoa.org/). Through CocoaHeads I've met dozens of people I now consider close friends and peers not to mention the education opportunities.

Over the past few years I've tried to give back to the community, specifically to other leaders, from causal conversations and advice to a formal talk I did at 360iDev. This new site is an extension of those recommendations with a modern discussion forum to help address specific questions as they pop up.

If you think the content is relative, please sign up to [the forum](https://forum.groupleadership.club/) or subscribe to the [RSS feed](http://groupleadership.club/index.xml). If you know someone who might like such a site, please do share a link. Thanks for your help.
