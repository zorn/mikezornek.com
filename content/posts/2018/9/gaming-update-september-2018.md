Forgive me, it&#8217;s been a while since my [last gaming update][1]. So, what am I playing?

Well first off, I&#8217;m [officially done][2] with **Hearthstone**. It&#8217;s a shame cause I like the game, but the price has just gotten out of control.

I was playing a bunch of **World of Warcraft** over the summer and into the new expansion. I leveled my rogue [Paperkut][4] to 120 but ended up unsubscribing right when the raid came out. I&#8217;m not interested in doing the whole &#8220;guild and 2-3 nights a week&#8221; raiding schedule and while I&#8217;m sure I would enjoy the braindead yet soothing process of leveling and gearing my alts it will still be there for me in a few months. For now I wanted to try some new games and put some more time into programming side projects.

After WoW, I went retro, starting games of **Wind Waker**, **Earthbound** and even a **Pokemon Platinum** [Nuzlock][5]. I consider them all still active playthroughs. Since my [last nuzlock update][6] I was able to finish the second gym with only one death so far. ([RIP Perch, the Starly.][7])

And finally, last weekend I bought **[Cities Skylines][8]** &#8212; and oh man am I having fun building my cities. I&#8217;ll fault the game with having a poor built-in tutorial process but I was saved by lots of helpful web tips and tutorials. The base game is $29 with lots of paid for DLC. You don&#8217;t need the DLC to get started so if you fancy city simulators and have not checked it out yet, I do recommend. PC preferred, since it has a large mod community.
