I just got back from my WWDC 2018 Social trip and it was a lot of fun. I figured I&#8217;d do a quick recap of the social side and leave room to talk about the tech stuff as I get deeper into the session videos in the weeks to come.

## Costs

With a nod to [Manton&#8217;s lead][1] I thought I too would share my costs in order to help others understand what is possible despite WWDC generally being a large cost these days.

  * Plane fare (Southwest, Philadelphia to San Jose Roundtrip taking the early and late times to save a little bit extra): **$564.00** 
  * [Hotel][2]: ($125/night, 4 nights + taxes & early checkin fee). Booked early on event date assumptions, was cancelable.: **$642.00**
  * Airport cab fair: **$25** each way.
  * WWDC conference ticket: **$0** (Big savings here obviously. If you can get value from the labs, the $1700 ticket cost can pay for itself but if you just want to watch the sessions, enjoy the free video streams on delay).
  * AltConf conference ticket: **$0** (I&#8217;ve bought the $300 Hero ticket in the past but held back this year since I&#8217;m on my own again and trying to keep costs down. Kind of feel bad considering how well I enjoyed the talks there this year.)
  * Food and drinks: **~$300** Made a point to get some supplies at a grocery store early in the week so I could supplement eating out with some in-room breakfast mornings and snacks.
  * Podcast and other event tickets: **~$50**

**Total: ~$1600**

> TL;DR: Make your decision about WWDC early and keep an eye on the rumored dates. Book early with hotels that are cancelable. If you need some more help, find a roommate to split hotel/cab costs with. 

## Events

On Sunday night I attended the sjMacIndie party and saw a lot of conference friends. Venue was a little on the warm side but plenty of space so it didn&#8217;t get too stuffy. I did not recognize much of San Jose from my earlier WWDC trips (2002-2004) but I did recognize this venue as the previous pool hall where the student scholarship winners once had a party. In fact it was at said party where I won an iPod which I later sold to help cover my plane fare back in the day.

> You can check out some of the old [WWDC 2002 Student coverage][3] we did via Wayback Machine and [this video][4], with footage from the pool hall, I was able to find and re-upload. 

On Monday I watched the Keynote and State of the Union with friends at the hotel. We had to jump wifi networks a few times but overall was very successful. Afterwords I headed to the live recording of ATP podcast which was a lot of fun.

On Tuesday I took in a few AltConf talks and also attended the Micro.Blog meetup. Really enjoyed the Setapp talk about their growth/recommendations and the detailed talk on improving app startup times. I also took some time on Tuesday to work on my own project, finally breaking down a long list of tasks into a new Pivotal Tracker project so I can start to track things better.

On Wednesday did more AltConf stuff. Really enjoyed Paul Hudson&#8217;s review of new iOS 12 additions. Also had a good time in the Finding Product Fit lab. At night I attended the Relay FM podcast recording which went great. Afterwords I went to the Breakpoint / AppCampForGirls event. I didn&#8217;t stay too long though, place was really dark and loud. Also kind of irked me that there was a separate VIP section. I really dislike the social cliques that pop up at industry conferences and seeing the VIP thing put a bad taste in my mouth.

> Aside: I&#8217;d love to see some options for non-bar night events at conferences. A 24 hour hacking lab with whiteboard grouping around ideas; maybe with room corners for Mario Karting or boardgames/poker. I like hanging out but I don&#8217;t like drinking too much and I can&#8217;t hear people over the crowds. I miss [MacHack][5] in many ways. Maybe I&#8217;ll lead by example some day should I ever dawn my event organizer hat again. 

On Thursday I got to attend a few morning talks at AltConf before heading home. Of them I really enjoyed the review of what Firebase is offering these days. I&#8217;ve been watching them since before they were bought by Google. Like any third-party component you have to accept some risk but I welcome the opportunity to use them to bootstrap a new idea some time in the future.

The journey home took a long while. I didn&#8217;t sleep much but did enjoy a bunch of podcasts.

Overall WWDC 2018 Social was a great success. It was awesome to say hi to some internet/conference friends and hear how everyone is doing. Now that I&#8217;m home it&#8217;s time to jump into the technical content and see what the WWDC sessions have to share. I&#8217;ll post more on that as I experiment.
