I&#8217;ve been kind of heads down with client work the last few months but wanted to say hi to those who still follow me here.

2017 was a bit of a sucker punch for me, but I survive.

After losing my job and having a neck surgery to open the year I was able to reboot my self employment under [a new LLC][1]. It took a few months but I finally landed some client work and have things pretty stable these days.

As for side projects I put a lot of time into [OwlDeck][2] in the spring but sadly it took a backseat to client work and revenue once summer rolled around. There is a good chance of it finding a second wind in 2018 as I have a bunch of teaching planned and it would be a great tool to have onhand.

I also decided this year to hand off my [Philly CocoaHead][3] responsibilities. I had been lead organizer for about 7 years and figured it was time. I still plan to be an active member but hope the extra hours can be put towards side projects in 2018.

Finally I&#8217;ve been learning new tech! I really want to get back into some web development and dedicated a fair amount of 2017 to relearning the web, from HTML5, to modern CSS (Flex, Grid, etc.) as well as new languages like [Elixir][4] and [Elm][5].

My first Elm site is underway and I&#8217;ll share more as it comes together.

Thanks for checking in. Be sure to [follow me on Micro.Blog][6] as well. Have a great 2018!
