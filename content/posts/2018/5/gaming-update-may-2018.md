From [April trends][1], I continued to play Stardew Valley into early May. It kind of died off over the last few weeks though since I don&#8217;t have much left to do, beside more and more money.

I also finished April pretty heavy into the new Hearthstone expansion. It was fun to see the new cards and decks. Nothing ground breaking, fun times and good fodder while I also listen to podcasts.

What&#8217;s new for me is my second attempt at Zelda on Switch. I&#8217;ve made it much further than my first attempt (~ 15 hours in) and am getting better with the controls (though some mistakes still happen in the heat of battle). Exploring is fun though if I&#8217;m honest I feel like I would benefit from a little more direction. In my last play session I was tasked to fetch some arrows on a hill. There is a mob up there who I attempted to kill. I say attempted cause he kicked my ass repeatedly. I&#8217;ve been trying to avoid walkthroughs for this game but I wanted to take a peek to see if I was suppose to be here later in play, with more hearts and armor &#8212; turns out you are suppose to be stealthy and avoid this mob. We&#8217;ll see how that goes.

Second big update for me is Civilization 6! I bought the game when it first came out but never got too deep into it. I think I tripped over a YouTube video or something which put it back in my mind but yeah, I&#8217;m really enjoying it. It&#8217;s my first ever Civ game and the rules are overwhelming but fun to learn. The games last forever and it&#8217;s hard to put down so be prepared to dump major hours into game sessions. I&#8217;ve been playing standard games but it does have a lot of scenarios for a quicker experience I want to try out.

What&#8217;s next? Probably more Civilization 6 and Zelda. I also did purchase via pre-order Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze and Hyrule Warriors for Switch. I never got to play them on the WiiU but they look like fun. Also getting excited for E3 in June. There have been some Pokemon leaks for the Switch game and I&#8217;m a little nervous about the Go integration rumors but we&#8217;ll see how it turns out.
