If you are reading this, then the DNS gods have shown you to my new [Linode][1] web server!

Not really sure if I&#8217;m happy with WordPress in the long term, but I wanted to move this blog off my old server asap so I stuck with it through the migration. This was the last site to be moved off that old server and now I can close up that account and save $40 a month.

Feels great to be back on Linode too. We used to use Linode back in the day during a old startup I was in (had a few app server nodes, node balancer, db node). I really like the raw access we get on Linode and that it feels like a real computer (unlike AWS which feels like witchcraft for me).
