Long time Apple developer Manton Reece is broken, sources in the Reece household have shared. After embracing a micro format with [Micro.blog][1] and now [microcasts][2], Manton has now instituted &#8220;micro&#8221; all over his household, from Micro.bed to Micro.dinner.

> &#8220;Dinner is now severed on these little Barbie-sized plates. It&#8217;s a sick joke. I&#8217;m starving.&#8221; 

Apparently the family is looking into a Micro.therapist for assistance. Manton could not be reached for Micro.comment.
