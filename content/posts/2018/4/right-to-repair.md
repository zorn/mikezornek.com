[Via phoneArena:][1]

> It has been reported that iOS 11.3 has disabled some iPhone 8 touch displays. The devices affected are those who have had third party displays installed. These displays are typically installed by local repair shops and are not affiliated with Apple.

I&#8217;ve been a supporter of the [Right to Repair movement][2] and Apple once again disappoints. Perhaps the issue is a anomaly but if the past is pattern and without providing comment, then it feels like spite.

Louis Rossman has a good [breakdown video][3] you can watch for more info.

**UPDATE:** Another relivent story today: [FTC: Warranty-voiding language like Nintendo’s and Sony’s is illegal][4]
