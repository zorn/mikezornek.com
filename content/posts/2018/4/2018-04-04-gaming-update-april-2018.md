So [last month][1] I explained how I recently unsubscribed from WoW, somewhat because of it&#8217;s addictive nature and somewhat due to an interest in catching up with my growing game backlog. A few weeks in what do I do but replace it with new crack in the form of Stardew Valley.

I remember buying and playing Stardew Valley when it first came out (along side [when I built my current PC gaming rig][2]) and while I thought it was neat at the time it didn&#8217;t grab my attention from WoW.

A few years later, one of my let&#8217;s player subs starts doing [a series][3] with it and it got me really hooked. It shares a lot of the &#8220;build&#8221; feelings I get from Dragon Quest Builders (which has sadly died down since I started my farm) but adds a lot of personality with it&#8217;s pixel art style and unique town characters. The realtime day cycle and never ending things to do makes it extremely addictive to play for me. (Just one more day&#8230;)

So yeah, I&#8217;m in Year 3 of my farm. It&#8217;s pretty much end game content and achievement stuff now. I am contemplating doing my own Let&#8217;s Play (with a new farm) with it but we&#8217;ll see.

In other game news, I have been continuing to play Secret of Mana. I probably have 2 more sessions before that one will be done. I think I&#8217;m going to finish the story but leave the grind-y achievements be and move on.

Last month I mentioned Pokemon Ultra Moon and I didn&#8217;t get too far. I finished the first island but not feeling it at the moment so put it down. (This despite catching a shiny Zorua too!)

I did fire up Hearthstone for a few play sessions at the end of the month. Wanted to make sure I got my card back for the month&#8217;s season. Also looking forward to the new expansion which should land mid-April.

One nice thing they are doing right now is rewarding full packs with quest completion. The cost to own cards is something that makes it hard for me to recommend Hearthstone to new players. Let&#8217;s hope their generosity continues in the year to come.

Up next? I&#8217;d really like to give Zelda: Breath of the Wild a second chance. I put in like 5 hours when I first got it but nothing since.
