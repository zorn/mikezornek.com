Things have been pretty quite here so I thought I&#8217;d update you all on some things, you know the important stuff &#8212; like gaming!

First, what I&#8217;m not playing, World of Warcraft. I still love WoW. I think the Legion expansion went very well. I do however find myself playing it too much. As an example, I can sit down for a WoW play session and it will go on for hours, sometimes filling up most of the day. Whereas when I play other games I usually cap out at a healthy 90 minutes or so. Thats what I need to do so I can keep up with my work side projects as well as get into a pile of games I&#8217;ve bought over the last year but haven&#8217;t gotten into. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be back to WoW in time but I&#8217;m due for a good break.

So what am I playing? First up, I&#8217;ve been enjoying Dragon Quest Builders on the Switch the last two weeks or so. It&#8217;s a mix of Minecraft and live action RPG gameplay. It plays in the Dragon Quest 1 world and oozes nostalgia in it&#8217;s monsters, music and lore.

Next up is the Secret of Mana remake on PS4. This was one of my top games growing up and has an OST that I still listen to on a weekly basis while I work. The remake has been very controversial in gaming circles, mostly for the new music not living up to expectations. Overall I still prefer the SNES music as well but I don&#8217;t hate the remake at all. I find it a fun revisit to a classic game with a new flavor. And if you want the original music, it is included as a option.

Finally we have Pokemon Ultra Moon. I didn&#8217;t get too far into this remix version Generation 7 when it first came out. At the time I had just finished collecting the regional dex for Pokemon Sun so I ended up taking a break. Having been a few months out, it&#8217;s nice to be back. Despite the repetitive nature of the &#8220;remix&#8221; I still have fun. I even was lucky enough to get a Shiny Zorua for my early team.
