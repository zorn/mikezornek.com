In general, I prefer asynchronous communication. The freedom it gives the participants to contribute to the conversation at a time that best works for them can be helpful and sometimes outright required if you are collaborating with folks outside your time zone.

That said, the delay in getting a proper answer can be frustrating.

I used to attempt to preload questions in my own emails/messages to people. Sometimes it would be as simple as a flat list of questions, and other times, I'd give them a logic path for if yes, then question x, or if no, question y. I have learned that this is a mistake. 

My experience dictates many people do not work well with this complexity. They miss questions or details entierly. The eventual awkwardness of repeating questions is enough that I will do simple, single questions, one at a time.

This lack of comprehension could result from our distracted culture, which for many includes answering SMS messages and interacting with phone notifications non-stop. I feel disempowered to fight those winds.

Sometimes, I find a peer where multiple questions will work, but that is something that is earned and not assumed.
