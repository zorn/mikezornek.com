One of the joys of [self-employment](/elixir-consulting/) is having a little extra control over your day-to-day schedule. 

In the past, during the time between paid projects, I have enjoyed casual open meetings with folks around the software developer community. 

Right now, work is light, and I have extra room to chat, so I figured I'd promote the opportunity.

**If you have an interesting side project in the works, an Elixir or LiveView question, or just want to chat about software development, schedule a call.**
