Took a few moments tonight to record a short demo of [RankedVote.app](https://rankedvote.app/) (Project name: [Flick](https://github.com/zorn/flick)) tonight.

> Flick is a simple Elixir / Phoenix LiveView app that helps capture ranked votes.
>
> This project was built to help the [Elixir Book Club](https://elixirbookclub.github.io/website/) pick books, but it is open to all.

I'm going to moving on to other side projects and seems as good a time as any to capture this in action.
