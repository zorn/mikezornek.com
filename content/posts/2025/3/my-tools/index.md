A bit of an snapshot and inventory of the tools I use on a regular basis. Documenting what I like and dislike. Open to new ideas, so if you see something you have a recommendation for let me know.

## Hardware

* 2021 Apple M1 Max MacBook Pro, 16-inch with 32 GB of RAM and 1 TB of storage.
  * Laptop is treating me well. Never really observing notable slow downs on anything I do day to day. I would like to revist a jump to desktop Linux someday as my relationship with Apple continues to deteriate. That however is a large change cost. I might consider reinitialzing my [old Framework laptop](https://mikezornek.com/posts/2021/9/framework-first-thoughts/) and try that some day.
