After a bad luck run where I had to cancel Elixir-related conferences last minute (once because of the smoke storms that hit NY, and one because I got COVID before the conference) this week I enjoyed some time at [CodeBEAM America 2025 in San Francisco](https://codebeamamerica.com/).

* The chaos of the real world was not front and center in most talk (which is fine with me as I enjoy the escape), but it did leak through at times. I recall a specific moment where a Ingela Anderton Andin was doing OTP update. She was remote, presenting from her home in Sweden. There was some chatter at the end talking about how the conference would love to see her return in-person in the United States in the upcoming year. There was this uneasiness in her response. Aknowledging without fully verbalizing the state of international relations. I had the same reaction seeing the upcoming callendar of events of BEAM things going on in Europe. I'm not sure if US people will be welcome there in 6 months.
