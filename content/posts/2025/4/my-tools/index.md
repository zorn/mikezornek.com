description: A snapshot and inventory of the tools I use on a regular basis.
---

It is good to take inventory of things from time to time. Here is a list of the tools I use day-to-day as of today, April 2, 2025.

I very much welcome hearing your own suggestions for tools I should consider in the future.

## Hardware

* 2021 Apple M1 Max MacBook Pro, 16-inch with 32 GB of RAM and 1 TB of storage.
  * Laptop is treating me well. Never observing notable slow downs on normal activities. I would like to revisit a jump to desktop Linux someday as my relationship with Apple continues to deteriorate. That however is a large switch cost. I might consider reinitializing my [old Framework laptop](https://mikezornek.com/posts/2021/9/framework-first-thoughts/) and try that some day in 2025. 
* Keyboard: [Das Keyboard 4 for Mac](https://www.daskeyboard.com/daskeyboard-4-professional-for-mac/)
  * I'm fairly satisfied with this. Have had it for many years now. Having experimented with a few other keyboards while building my gaming PC, I am considering experimenting with alternative here soon.
* Mouse: Logitech Performance MX Wireless Mouse
  * This is an older discontinued model but one I've been very happy with. I've replaced the internal rechargeable battery a few times but it has held up great. I have a newer MX Master 3S model for my gaming PC. It fits my hand as well and I might update on my main computer in time.
* Microphone: Shure SM7B
  * This is complete overkill for for my daily needs but I had intent on building more video content at one point and it was purchased as part of that project. I do use it a lot, but mostly for Zoom and Discord calls.
* Camera: Canon VIXIA HF G21 Full HD Camcorder and Elgato Cam Link
  * This is a older 1080p camcorder that I connect to my laptop via a HDMI adaptor for use as a standard laptop camera input. 
* Monitors: I use a pair of [24-inch LG UltraFine monitors](https://www.lg.com/us/business/computer-monitors/lg-24md4klb-b) mounted on [Fully Jarvis Dual Monitor Mounting Arms](https://store.hermanmiller.com/collection-jarvis). These are holding up ok. There is some screen burn-in and compared to the new gaming monitor I have feel a little dated but overall they are more than fine for the work I do. The monitor arms are really nice and keep the screens at a much higher eye height for me. I recommend in investing in monitor arms, Jarvis or otherwise.
* Laptop stand: Rain Design mStand Laptop Stand
  * I use my laptop open when connected to the monitors and than place it on this laptop stand to get some extra height. This gives me three monitors in total (one for terminal, one for code editor and one for browser).
* iPad Pro
  * I bought this last year after using my previous iPad Pro for like 8 years or so. I went for the higher end version, primarily for the screen but I like the camera unlock and overall feel. I use this daily from my recliner, mostly for web browsing and PDF reading.
* iPhone Xr
  * I've been milking this older phone for a while and it still holds up. Batter is good and no major issues. I figured I'd keep using it until OS updates stopped, which I expected this past year but still got them. Suspect I'll need a new phone soonâ„¢. Might consider something else than iPhone though.
* Gaming PC
  * I [blogged about this](https://mikezornek.com/posts/2024/12/new-gaming-pc/) with details before. It is holding up great and providing high end graphics for Civ7. I had one night where I ended up having to debug and reinstall fan drivers which is kind of par for the course when it comes to a custom build and ongoing Windows updates.
* Steam Deck
  * I have not used this as much as I would have liked. The main game I played on it was Final Fantasy 6 Pixel Remaster. I feel like someday I might load it up with some ROMs and use it as an emulation hub for for now it is kind of collecting dust.
* Playstation 5
  * I play this all the time, mostly MLB: The Show from my living room.
* Switch
  * I play this in phases, usually when a new games comes out or I get nostalgic. Have been considering a fresh Animal Crossing island reroll.
