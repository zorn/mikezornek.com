I try to revisit my budget every six months or so, and having just wrapped up my taxes, which provide helpful totaling of where the money went last year, it was a good time to rebuild the numbers.

In the past, I've used [Soulver](https://soulver.app/) for some of this, and while I still like that app, this time, I took a shot using a Google Spreadsheet. 

I liked how the expense spreadsheet came out and thought there would be value in [sharing a demonstration of it](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KzNSURgiVZPU61WKT4sTkO-5fAT124I6J3emVJX4L50/edit?usp=sharing).

I've recorded a video of its creation to help those who might not be spreadsheet experts and to capture my thought process regarding cataloging expenses for future scenario experimentation.

## Video Summary

- Track each expense with a `Description`, `Cost`, and `Occurrence` (Monthly or Yearly).
- Mark each expense as `Hard`, `Medium`, or `Soft` to express the importance of this expense to you (how hard would it be to live without).
- Use bank and credit card statements to help you capture all things.
- Use a column to convert `Yearly` costs into a `Monthly` equivalent, the base time unit we work with here.
- Add a `Scenario` checkbox column to help you experiment with what expenses can be removed to reach your target goal.
- Utilize features like share, comments, and versioning to work with others.
