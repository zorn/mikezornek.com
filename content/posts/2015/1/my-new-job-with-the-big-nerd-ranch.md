As I [posted on Twitter a few weeks ago][1], I recently accepted a new job with the [Big Nerd Ranch][2]. The job itself starts tomorrow and I&#8217;m really excited.

The Big Nerd Ranch and its founder Aaron Hillegass have already made a huge impact on my career. When I first started to learn to program for Mac OS X I turned to Cocoa Programming for OS X. It was the, then unlabeled, first edition of the book and it was a game changer for me. Not only did I fall in love with Cocoa but the book itself was incredibly well written and helpful. Later while attending MacHack I was even able to get a pre-conference day of training from BNR. It too was great and the teacher, Chris Campbell, was really [helpful with me getting my MegaManEffect hack][4] to work. (It even took second place in the hack contest!)

These days Big Nerd Ranch is still known for their awesome books and [educational classes][6], which now cover way more than just Macintosh and include iOS, Android, Rails and a much more. The Big Nerd Ranch also [codes for hire][7], doing consulting projects for various clients big and small.

Myself, I&#8217;ll mainly be teaching and preparing new teaching materials to start. To think, I&#8217;m going to be helping craft the very books that got me started &#8212; it&#8217;s a real honor. In time I&#8217;ll probably also help do some consulting but for now, the focus is on education.

I&#8217;ll work remotely from Philadelphia and travel as needed for the classes (probably 1 week every 5 or so) and to checkin with my coworkers down on the ranch in Atlanta on occation. I&#8217;ll post info on my travel plans as they evolve. I&#8217;d love to connect with other CocoaHead chapters and various &#8220;conference friends&#8221; during my travels that I&#8217;d otherwise only see at WWDC and such.

To the company I&#8217;m leaving, [Tonic Design][8] (formerly DmgCtrl), I want to say thank you. DmgCtrl took me in with a very warm welcome when I was in a bit of a rut doing solo consulting (both creatively and emotionally) and I&#8217;m extremely grateful to them for the opportunity. Over the past year+ we&#8217;ve built a lot of cool stuff together and I wish them the best of luck moving forward.

Anyways it&#8217;s going to be an exciting fews days as I get familiar with all the internal Big Nerd Ranch stuff, and to my new coworkers who might find this, I&#8217;ll see you in Atlanta for a week of introductions and geeking out real soon.
