It&#8217;s June 1st and [WWDC][1] is right around the corner!

My [wish list][2] is set and I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll have lots to talk about in the weeks and months ahead. It&#8217;s going to be a great conference.

I won&#8217;t be at WWDC proper this year but will be in town, next door at [AltConf][3]. AltConf has a [great speaker lineup][4] unto itself and I believe it will also be [live streamed][5].

If you see me in town, please introduce yourself. I love connecting a face to a twitter avatar of a cat.

Other notes and resources&#8230;

As for the parties, one good index of events is right here: <https://2015.wwdcparties.com/>.

Big Nerd Ranch is also reaching out to meet our fans. We are hosting breakfast and dinner meetups. More info: <https://twitter.com/bignerdranch/status/604034663150059522>

And finally, if you&#8217;ll be in Philly instead of San Fransisco, consider attending the CocoaHeads keynote steam event at the Apple Store: <http://www.meetup.com/PhillyCocoaHeads/events/222711398/>
