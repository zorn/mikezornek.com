It&#8217;s been a little over two years since I put [Clickable Bliss][1], the company name for my personal projects, then self-employment, on hiatus after taking a job at DmgCtrl (which then turned into a job at Big Nerd Ranch). Back then when [I wrote about the change][2], I mentioned that team work was something I was really missing after my group startup Shindig ended. The good news is, in the last 2 years time I&#8217;ve gotten to work with some very talented people and have learned a ton from them. The sad news is, the yearning to work on something longterm, something of my own, something I can have a meaningful impact on does not go away. Today I&#8217;d like to share my intent to reboot my professional side projects.

I say &#8220;professional&#8221; side projects because I do want these to be serious projects that result in profitable products. I want to create software that people enjoy using, solve meaningful problems and people are willing to pay for. I&#8217;m not looking to quit my job but I don&#8217;t want that to be an excuse for lack of progression or service level, I want to make sure my customers are taken care of.

So what&#8217;s next? Well right now I&#8217;m working on breaking down some project ideas and otherwise trying to get up to speed with some tech stacks I&#8217;m considering using. I&#8217;m also trying to figure out the legal and branding side of things. Some questions on my mind:

  * Do I continue to do work under the name Clickable Bliss (which is a D.B.A.) or do I come up with a new company name that helps distinguish this new era and long term team intent (I do hope to bring on help for these new projects sooner than later).
  * If I do a new company name, do I run it as an LLC?
  * Do I promote these products under the company brand or just build brands around the project(s) themselves. (The two leading ideas I&#8217;d like to work on have fairly divergent audiences although longterm I&#8217;d say my interest is in providing tools for people who embrace technology to create things.)
  * I want to start to build up a newsletter as soon as I have some more concrete things to share. How do I migrate those people from the old Clickable Bliss mailing list? Should I?

So that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on. Will share more when I have it. If you have any feedback or comments, please [shoot me an email!][3]
