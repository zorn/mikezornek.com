We&#8217;ve been trying to a better job of capturing our main talks at [Philly CocoaHeads][1]. You can find and subscribe to our small but growing collection of videos on Vimeo: <https://vimeo.com/phillycocoa>.

I did a talk last month reviewing a some iOS code patterns. The runtime is about 27 minutes. [Feedback very welcome.][2]

Update April 27, 2025: Video not available.

Some Code Patterns, Mike Zornek from [Philly CocoaHeads][4] on [Vimeo][5].

This talk covers a handful of code patterns that were successful on my recent projects. Some of these patterns include Block Safety, "Tell, Don't Ask", Using DataSources for your network-based *Service objects.

Apologies the audience participation isn't well captured.
