## Day 14: OmniFocus

> This post is part of [a larger series][1] where for 31 days I&#8217;m posting a story about a particular product or service I&#8217;ve come to enjoy.

[OmniFocus][2], from the OmniGroup, is a task manager that embraces the work style of [Getting Things Done][3].

I&#8217;ve been an on again and off again user of GTD / OmniFocus for many years now. I&#8217;ve done GTD through index cards, automated scripts over OmniOutliner and then eventually OmniFocus. For the years where I did stop, it was mostly because I was taking time off my side work and frankly didn&#8217;t have that much to keep track of. Over the last few months however I&#8217;ve been taking on more things and setting up some [long term goals][4]. OmniFocus has really helped me stay on track and keep up with my responsibilities.

A bit about my setup. I use the Mac version primarily but also own the iOS version for occasional reference and general OmniGroup UI-fanboy reasons. I have project folders for Personal, Work, CocoaHeads and Clickable Bliss (Relaunch). I also have projects named &#8220;Tasks&#8221; and &#8220;Someday Maybe&#8221; for each responsibility which is a great place for one-off things. I&#8217;m much better about doing my Reviews since restarting, typically doing them on Mondays. I take the time to not only cleanup my inbox, mark done things which I have yet to check off but to also flag those items for which I want to work on that week. Some of my flags are a little more well-wishing then they should be but I like having the flag context be my &#8216;sit down at desk, what do I need to do today&#8217; list.

I also use a [browser extension][5] for quick recording of URLs. This isn&#8217;t the Read Later stuff I send to [Instapaper][6], but more the, hey I&#8217;m writing an app in EmberJS and here&#8217;s a great article on authentication. Let me add it to the EmberJS research project. Or, heres a great gift idea for my sister, let me add the URL to the Buy Christmas Presents project.

[OmniFocus][2] for Mac does have a [free trial][7]. When you are ready to buy you can use the [Mac App Store][8] or buy from [OmniGroup direct][9]. Standard Edition is $40, Pro is $80. The iOS app ([App Store][10]) is similarly, $40 for Standard and $60 for Pro.
