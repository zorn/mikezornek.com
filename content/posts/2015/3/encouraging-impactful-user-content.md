I&#8217;m not one to do a ton of online product reviews but after CocoaLove I was asked to do one for the walking tour we took on Sunday. The site was TripAdvisor and from what I hear having good reviews there is really important for companies so I figured I&#8217;d share the love.

Since posting the review I&#8217;d say I get an email from TripAdvisor every 3 months or so. The email helps explain how much of an impact my review has made.

I really like the email.

I suspect emails like this help encourage further user contributions. If your website or service captures user generated content I&#8217;d encourage you to experiment with similar behaviors.
