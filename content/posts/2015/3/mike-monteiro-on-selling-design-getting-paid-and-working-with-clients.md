I&#8217;m not sure if &#8220;Selling Design&#8221; is the real title for the [Keynote at Interaction15][1] (1h5m) but that&#8217;s the topic your are going to see. Mike Monteiro a does a great job reviewing some of the pitfalls creative people run into when working with and presenting their work to clients and all the delicacies of those relationships. For those doing contract work, a must see.

You might also like Mike&#8217;s talk: [Fuck You, Pay Me][2] or his books, [Design is a Job][3] and [You&#8217;re My Favorite Client][4].

Contracting and project management are topics that regularly come up at my job, Philly CocoaHeads and IndyHall so I&#8217;m going to try to do better about writing about those issues here. In the mean time, I highly recommend Mike&#8217;s work to get your own brain turning.
