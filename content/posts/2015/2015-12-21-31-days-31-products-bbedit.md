## Day 22: BBEdit

> This post is part of [a larger series][1] where for 31 days I&#8217;m posting a story about a particular product or service I&#8217;ve come to enjoy.

There are lots of text editors out there for Mac OS X and I&#8217;ll be up front in saying I use different ones for different tasks. When it comes to extremely large files, large find and replace, text file corruption or general system configuration files, I turn to [BBEdit][2].

I&#8217;ve been a long time BBEdit user, going back to when I first started with the Mac during the &#8220;Classic&#8221; days. It&#8217;s one of the most solid, stable text editors out there and a great tool to add to your collection.

BBEdit has a [free trial available][3]. A license will cost you $49 and can be purchase directly from the [Bare Bones Software store][4].
