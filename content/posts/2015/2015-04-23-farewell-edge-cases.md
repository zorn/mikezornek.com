Cue the [Journey song][1], [Edge Cases][2] is ending.

Edge Cases was a podcast hosted by long time Apple developers [Andrew Pontious][3] and [Wolf Rentzsch][4]. Surprising unlike many other podcasts hosted by Apple developers, Edge Cases actually embraced the code, doing weekly non-topical coverage of coding concepts, practices and history. The show ends after 128 episodes and will be missed.

I&#8217;ve been following Wolf since the MacHack days and Andrew since the blogging boom of the early 2000s. Both are incredibly insightful and genuine. I want to thank them for putting on such a great show. The dedication it takes to run a regularly published podcast is no small feat and it was appreciated. I wish them well with their future projects.

If you haven&#8217;t listened to the [Edge Cases][2] show before I encourage you to browse the archives and give it a try. The content is timeless.
