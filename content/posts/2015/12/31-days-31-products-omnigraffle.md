## Day 20: OmniGraffle

> This post is part of [a larger series][1] where for 31 days I&#8217;m posting a story about a particular product or service I&#8217;ve come to enjoy.

[OmniGraffle][2] is a an app from the OmniGroup that lets people design, I&#8217;ll call them, component-based compositions; things like data models, website wireframes, and more.

I&#8217;ve been a long time user of OmniGraffle, in particular I love using it to make flow charts to help visualize app launch sequences or data download flows. I&#8217;ve even recently come to use it to help me plan furniture arrangements in my apartment (side note: I really want to get more space in the future, I miss having a dedicated office space).

OmniGraffle is probably not an app you&#8217;ll need on a daily basis but when you do, it&#8217;s really nice to use and can help you produce some awesome documentation. Like all the Omni apps, it&#8217;s extremely well done with lots of polish and documentation.

While this plug is for the Mac version of OmniGraffle I do want to mention that I did purchase the iOS version when I got my iPad Pro a few weeks ago too. While I&#8217;ve only spent 15 minutes with it on the iPad it really feels well done and I encourage you to check it out if interested.

OmniGraffle for Mac does have a [free demo available][4]. A license can be purchased for $99 Standard or $199 Pro from the [Omni Store][5] or the [Mac App Store][6].
