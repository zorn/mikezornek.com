## Day 12: Instapaper

> This post is part of [a larger series][1] where for 31 days I&#8217;m posting a story about a particular product or service I&#8217;ve come to enjoy.

[Instapaper][2] is an app that let&#8217;s you mark articles to be &#8220;read later&#8221; and then presents them to you in a very clean, ad-free environment. I&#8217;ve been a long time Instapaper fan (before similar services like Pocket or Safari&#8217;s own reading list were even available); it&#8217;s an app that really shines on the iPad for long couch sessions. It&#8217;s also pretty good about storing the content for offline reading in case you are on a plane with a no connection.

I highly recommend Instapaper. The ability to collect up all your readings is particularly efficient. Additionally, you may find that when your time is being blocked off you might be a little more choosy about which article you want to give your time. Do not put pressure on yourself to empty your list. Treat it as an basket of possibilities.

Instapaper has clients for iOS, Android and the desktop web. The apps and the service are free, but there is a [premium option][3] for $29/year to help symbolize your support and get a few more features.
