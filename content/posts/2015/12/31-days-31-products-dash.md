## Day 26: Dash

> This post is part of [a larger series][1] where for 31 days I&#8217;m posting a story about a particular product or service I&#8217;ve come to enjoy.

[Dash][2] is a super nice and clean API Documentation Browser.

![Dash][3]

I use Dash with Xcode and iOS/Mac API primarily but you can in fact integrate Dash with a long list of other third party code editors and download over 150 language/API document sets too.

Having the API docs available at the click of a mouse (or key command) from your favorite text editor is a must have for any serious developer. If you been limited yourself you Xcode&#8217;s default experience I highly encourage you to try out Dash.

Dash does have a [free trial available][4] with an in-app purchase to unlock the full version for $25. It is available from the [App Store][5] as well [as direct][6].
