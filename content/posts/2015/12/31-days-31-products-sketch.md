## Day 25: Sketch

> This post is part of [a larger series][1] where for 31 days I&#8217;m posting a story about a particular product or service I&#8217;ve come to enjoy.

[Sketch][2] is a vector-based design tool for the Mac that is very good for people designing user interfaces.

I&#8217;ve owned Sketch for a while now. I&#8217;ve used it to mock up some UI and icons in the past but I&#8217;m not really an expert. I know enough to say I do like it and if you are interested in using it for interface design I highly recommend it.

I have a goal for the new year to become more proficient in Sketch. I&#8217;m signed up and really looking forward to attending the [Big Nerd Ranch class on UI design][3] in April. It includes teaching Sketch along side higher level UI concepts. I&#8217;ve also bought an [online video course][4] that I hope to start working through soon.

If you are at all curious I encourage you to [download the free trial][5] of Sketch and give it a go. If you like it, a license can be purchased for $99 from their [online store][6].
