## Day 09: Today

> This post is part of [a larger series][1] where for 31 days I&#8217;m posting a story about a particular product or service I&#8217;ve come to enjoy.

Weather apps are probably one of the biggest category of apps out there. Everyone has a favorite, and [Today][2] is mine.

For me the view I like the most is the visual seven day, showing the highs and the lows, using colors to express heat.

Not sure what else to say, it&#8217;s a simple app for a simple problem with a clean design and a unique take.

Today costs $1.99 and is available on the [App Store][5].
