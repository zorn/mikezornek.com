## Day 08: SimPholders

> This post is part of [a larger series][1] where for 31 days I&#8217;m posting a story about a particular product or service I&#8217;ve come to enjoy.

[SimPholders][2] is a great example of identifying a small but troublesome issue and building a simple solution for it. SimPholders is a menu bar extension that helps you quickly get at the most recent Xcode simulator builds in the Finder as well as a handful of other useful features.

I&#8217;ve been using SimPholders for a while and it&#8217;s really handy. I find myself often needing to sneak into a app&#8217;s documents folder to inspect a Core Data database, or fidget with some other resource and SimPholders makes it super easy. This despite all of the latest complexities of Xcode and the growth in simulator devices / platforms.

SimPholders has a [free trial][3] and when it&#8217;s up you can [buy a license][4] for $11 from their website.
