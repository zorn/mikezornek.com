## Day 13: SourceTree

> This post is part of [a larger series][1] where for 31 days I&#8217;m posting a story about a particular product or service I&#8217;ve come to enjoy.

[SourceTree][2] is Mac OS X app that serves as a UI front end for the popular version control system Git. (Upon writing this it seems to also support Mercurial as well, though my comments below are from the perspective of a git user.)

![SourceTree][3]

While I think it&#8217;s important for all git users to be comfortable with the command line interface I can&#8217;t help but personally prefer to interact with my repos more visually on a day-to-day basis. The SourceTree UI isn&#8217;t going to win any Apple Design Awards since it leaks the command line git to the user, but that&#8217;s fine with me. I&#8217;m not looking for visual-only version control for non-geeks &#8212; I just want a solid UI for my git interactions.

My favorite features include, spell checking my commit messages, diff-ing branches, easily stashing and de-stashing code snippets and the open in terminal window (for when I need it). I also enjoy having a visual UI for when I&#8217;m reviewing the commit stage and want to make sure no frivolous xib changes are going to be committed via accidental saves in Xcode.

SourceTree is a [free download][4] available from the Atlassian website though you may need to register for an unlock license.
