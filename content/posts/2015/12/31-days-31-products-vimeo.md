## Day 21: Vimeo

> This post is part of [a larger series][1] where for 31 days I&#8217;m posting a story about a particular product or service I&#8217;ve come to enjoy.

When it comes to professional video hosts, I choose [Vimeo][2].

![Vimeo][3]

[Vimeo][2] is a video hostingÂ site that empowers creators to have more control over how their content is displayed and distributed than other services like YouTube.

I like using Vimeo since I can pay for a Pro account which then let&#8217;s me upload HD content, have access to that content via an API and makes sure no ads are ever shown over my content. Vimeo is also much more reasonable about ownership right.

Right now we use Vimeo for [Philly CocoaHeads][4] content and I have a [personal channel][5] as well with some odd and ends. No doubt as I look to do more work for my upcomming project you&#8217;ll see a new channel open up soon.

Vimeo has a [few tiers][6] of membership with different options and you get started with a trial account.
