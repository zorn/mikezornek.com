## Day 17: Elgato Game Capture HD

> This post is part of [a larger series][1] where for 31 days I&#8217;m posting a story about a particular product or service I&#8217;ve come to enjoy.

[Elgato Game Capture HD][2] is actually a hardware/software combo. Its an external capture device that does HDMI passthrough, grabbing whatever video signal you are passing through (be it from a video game console or computer display). It will them compress the video as mp4 on the device and and delver the compressed video to a Mac via a USB cable connection (which is also used for power). On the Mac you&#8217;ll run some software that saves the capture to disk and also optionally helps you stream to [Twitch][3].

I originally bought and used the Game Capture HD to help me record some Let&#8217;s Plays.

> Let&#8217;s Plays are video series where an individual will play a game, capture it as well as their commentary while they play. Some personalities are very detailed in the [mechanics and secrets][4] of the game while others treat the videos [very casually, almost as a diary of sorts][5], mixing in stories of the past as well as the present.

As for my own &#8220;Let&#8217;s Play career&#8221;, it was short lived. I had a bunch of fun doing a [handful of series][6] before quitting mid-way through Final Fantasy IV. I quit because I started to have other life goals and while fun, the amount work it took to produce the videos compared to their small impact &#8212; it didn&#8217;t feel worth it.

ANYWAYS&#8230; the Elgato Game Capture HD found its way to be useful for me once more this past year when we decided to start capturing CocoaHead talks. I now use the device to capture our HDMI output (before it&#8217;s redirected to the televisions) and I have to say the recorder software holds up well to us switching machines, resolutions and what not while recording. After the meeting, I take the videos from here and then match a separate audioÂ capture we do through a lapel microphone to build our final video, (edited in [ScreenFlow][7], and published on [Vimeo][8]).

If you are interested in video capture you can browse the [Elgato Gaming site][9] for a rundown of the current product lineup. The device I use is the base model and costs $150 retail but there are other options if you want higher frame rate capture (mine is 30 fps, they also have 60 fps available).
