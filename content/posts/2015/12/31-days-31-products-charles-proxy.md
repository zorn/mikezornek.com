## Day 15: Charles Proxy

> This post is part of [a larger series][1] where for 31 days I&#8217;m posting a story about a particular product or service I&#8217;ve come to enjoy.

Setting up an HTTP proxy to observe internet traffic on your machine is incredibly valuable when developing web or mobile applications. My tool of choice for such is [Charles Proxy][2].

It&#8217;s been a while since I really evaluated what else is on the market for this kind of need but as the saying goes, if it&#8217;s not broke, don&#8217;t fix it. I find CharlesÂ Proxy works well, particularly for observing SSL traffic on the iOS simulator which requires a bit of setup to get working right.

Charles Proxy has a [free trial available][3] and if you like it a license will cost you $50 from [their site directly][4].
