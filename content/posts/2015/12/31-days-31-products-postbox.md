## Day 18: Postbox

> This post is part of [a larger series][1] where for 31 days I&#8217;m posting a story about a particular product or service I&#8217;ve come to enjoy.

Email apps can be a point of contention for many people. For me I&#8217;ve settled into a very functional but plain setup.

At the base, I use a few Gmail accounts with lots of server side filtering into folders (for things like mailing lists, automated responses, etc). Then I use an IMAP-friendly desktop app. In recent years the IMAP-client of choice for me has been [Postbox][2], a fairly clean and strait-forward email client that has [its roots from the Thunderbird project][3]. Despite the cross platform support of Postbox (it runs on Windows too) it still fits in well on the Mac.

My email flow is as follows. I archive most email while deleting the outright trash. I&#8217;ll scan the new messages in my spam folder about once a week. I find I usually pull out a few emails which while are promotional though I wouldn&#8217;t consider outright spam. I do try to unsubscribe form things that are too noisy. When I need to search Postbox does a fairly good job for resent stuff though I&#8217;d be lying if I didn&#8217;t jump to the web version of Gmail for searches that need to go deep into the archives.

So yeah, Postbox is not the sexiest software out there for email but it serves me just fine and might be worth a look if you want something solid and simple.

A [free trial of Postbox][4] is available, and, if you like it, a license can be [purchased from them directly][5] for $15.
