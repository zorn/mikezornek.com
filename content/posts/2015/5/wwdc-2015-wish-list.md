While I won&#8217;t be at WWDC proper I will be in San Francisco the week of WWDC. I have a ticket to [AltConf][1] and otherwise expect to be mingling about.

What do I want to see announced? Here is some of my wish list.

## Swift Improvements

- Let me use Xcode&#8217;s refactor tool to refactor Swift.
- Let me use Instruments to measure performance of Swift.
- Introduce a tool similar to [`gofmt`][2]
- Add standard library tools for processing JSON.
- Continue to improve Obj-C Interoperability.
- Swift versions of NSDate and NSDecimalNumber
- Fix the &#8220;I have to make it public or double add the modules&#8221; to let tests see code issue.

## Xcode

- Introduce a cloud service version of Xcode Server.
- Improve Xcode Templates (eg: should recommend new test file with new class).
- Add code coverage tools.
- Improve testing tools. (Maybe add a formal UI testing layer?)
- Add a spell checker that is smart about function names and other symbols.
- Stability improvements.

## Others

- Let me slide loads apps outside the App Store.
- Improve App Store searching, browsing and discovery.
- Formal API to iTunes Connect.
- Third Party Siri access.
