Hello internets. So sorry for the summer hiatus here on the blog. So what have you been up to? ([Email me][1] and say hi!)

I&#8217;ve been doing good. WWDC was a fun time in June and shortly after that I had 6 days down the shore with my family. At work, I&#8217;ve been on a Swift iOS project. It&#8217;s my first time using Swift in production and working along side [John][2] and [Zac][3] has been incredibly educational. I also was able to get on the road and do my first solo teaching gig for Big Nerd Ranch. I really do enjoy teaching and hope to get the opportunity to do more of it in the coming year.

In my off time I&#8217;ve been zoning out with video games, movies and the like. I bought a PS4 and have been mixing it in amongst my WoW and FF14 time. I do feel guilty as I keep meaning to start some productive side projects but I struggle to focus on programming after working a full day doing programming. We&#8217;ll see how the fall works out. Hoping to get some project inspiration from [CocoaLove][4] and [Release Notes][5] in October.

I also just (like a week ago) got a new car. Ended up buying a new 2015 [Hyundai Sonata Sport][6]. It replaces my old 98 Ford Taurus workhorse. The Sonata is nice; very spacious and a nice mix of value and features. I&#8217;m really enjoying the iOS integration (used to use an external bluetooth speaker for podcasts and the like). With a little more confidence in my car now I&#8217;m actually hoping to hit to road a bit and do some visits to regional CocoaHead events and the like. If there is an event coming up you&#8217;d like to recommend [let me know][1].

Well that&#8217;s it for now. Bring on the fall!
