![Jobbies][1]

While looking for a new job last year I slowly built a list of questions I would ask the various companies to help better understand if they were a good fit for me. Some of these questions are ripped from other blog posts, like [The Joel Test][2], but many of them were from personal brainstorming and soul searching about what I wanted.

Hopefully this list helps those out there looking for something new.

## Culture

  * Pretend I know nothing about the company, how do you describe it?
  * Who owns the company? What are their interests?
  * How would you describe the company culture? 
  * What are its core values?
  * How is this evident in everyday action?
  * There is a [great TED talk][3] by Simon Sinek that has a simple but powerful model for inspirational leadership all starting with a golden circle and the question &#8220;Why?&#8221; He describes a circle with the word Why? in the center and then moving outward, How? and then What? &#8212; Simon explains that most people can answer the What, what do they do? &#8212; some fewer still can answer the How &#8212; but the truly successful can answer the Why? Why do they do it? Why does your company do what it does? Why does this company sell paper towels instead?
  * What can I see / download as a public example of your work?
  * Name something the company is struggling with and how you are trying to fix it?
  * Name something the company excels at? What are the lessons to be learned?
  * What&#8217;s going to change at this company over the next year? three years? five years?

  * Is there a standard process for the handing off assets, specs, motion simulations from the design team to the development team?

  * Do you ever have internal projects? How do they work?
  * How would you split up my weekly hours between different responsibilities?
  * How is customer support handled?
  * Do I have any interaction with the customers?

## Process (Client-based work)

  * If I&#8217;m working on a client project, what is my interaction with them?
