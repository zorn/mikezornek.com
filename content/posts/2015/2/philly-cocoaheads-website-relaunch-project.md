I haven&#8217;t had an active side project in the last few months. When asked I would tell people [looking for a new job][1] **was** my side project. Now that I have that new job search (and my [Girl Develop It class][2] behind me it&#8217;s time to kick something off; we&#8217;re going to rebuild the Philly CocoaHeads website!

When I took over the local chapter of CocoaHeads here in Philly (back in 2010 or so) the previous organizer had a Ruby/Markdown publish system setup. It was kind of neat but involved a lot of setup on the client box to get up and running. I had a few people posting to the site so rather than set up that system on each individual&#8217;s box I opted for WordPress. The WordPress site has done ok for us but we&#8217;ve been growing a ton and doing a lot more over the last year (workshops, video capture of meeting presentations). I&#8217;d love to start to centralize things like keeping track of our members and our money, overall there is a ton that could be automated and it&#8217;s time to make it happen.

I don&#8217;t want to do this alone and I also would love to start documenting the project as it unfolds. To get started we have a brainstorm session scheduled during [Side Project Saturday][3]. If you want to participate please consider stopping by. If you can&#8217;t stop by, but want to participate, [let me know][4] and maybe we can setup a Google Hangout call-in option. To capture notes I&#8217;m going to use Trello. The [board is live][5] and open to the public. (You will need to login with a Trello account to edit.) Feel free to start to document your ideas today.
