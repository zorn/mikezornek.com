This post is delayed due to a head cold I had last week, but considering the amount of effort and love that went into producing the [Release Notes Conference][1] I figured the least I can do is share my reaction.

In short, I think Joe and Charles have a really cool product here. Despite a somewhat saturated iOS conference space I think they have chiseled out a much needed and action-oriented event. The idea of an entire conference of content focused on building and growing your Apple-related business is great enough, but then consider you&#8217;ll end up mingling with similar minded people results in an incredible event.

I don&#8217;t want to understate the importance of actionable. There are a lot of tech conferences out there where you&#8217;ll see some very interesting talks that showcase some new language features or APIs but you can&#8217;t always come home and apply them to your current work right away. I think one of the best aspects of the Release Notes Conference is that no matter how young or old your business or product is, there were tons of actionable tasks to walk away with.

In many ways the conference reminded me fondly of the (pre-iPhone) MacSB (Mac Software Business) mailing list and IRC channel where a small group of us would hang out, post question and share notes. It was small, very welcoming and extremely helpful group.

My understanding is that the talks were recorded and will be published online, so if you are interested I highly recommend [signing up for their mailing list][2] for the announcement. Of course, if you aren&#8217;t subscribed already I&#8217;ll also recommend their [weekly podcast][2] which started it all.
