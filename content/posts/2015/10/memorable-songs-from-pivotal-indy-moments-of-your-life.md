While attending the [Release Notes Conference][1] this past week I saw a talk by [Mike Hurley][2] of [RelayFM][3] fame. A lot of the talk was pulling wisdoms from Mike&#8217;s own story, the history of his past projects up to working on RelayFM. One tidbit included an attachment to a song when he quit his job. For him the song was [Another One Bites the Dust, Queen][4].

For me when I quit my full time job with [ASMP][5] to focus on my Mac development work the song was [Maggie&#8217;s Farm, Bob Dylan][6]. I was really into Dylan at the time and the lyrics just fit. I remember blasting it from my office and hearing it play throughout the apartment those first few indy days working at home.

I&#8217;d love to hear what songs match up to your own big indy life moments. Shoot me [an email][7] or [tweet me][8] your story.
