Now that all the new bits of iOS 9 and OS X 10.11 are in the wild you might find yourself wanting to get up to speed on some of the changes. One great resource to help you get started is [Apple&#8217;s WWDC videos][1].

The WWDC video library has a lot going for it: HD and SD video sizes, slide downloads and now [even full text search][2]! The only real negative thing is the sheer amount of content out there. It can get overwhelming and time consuming to watch all the stuff you are interested in. Here&#8217;s the hint. Like podcasts, WWDC videos are mostly single voices speaking one at a time and if you have the tools to double the playback speed you&#8217;ll find them still very comprehensible.

Now for the tools. For downloading you can of course use the [Apple website][1]. I like this [WWDC Mac app][3] as well. Once you have the video file on your hard drive you&#8217;ll unfortunately need to look for something beside the built-in QuickTime player to help. Even with all its enhancements it sadly doesn&#8217;t have this tool of QuickTime&#8217;s past. The good news is you can still [download QuickTime 7][4] and it works great!

After you open your movie in QuickTime 7 (you&#8217;ll find it installed in the `Utilities` folder), use the `Window` menu and choose `Show A/V Controls`. In this panel you&#8217;ll see a slider that let&#8217;s you adjust the playback speed.

Now you can watch your chosen WWDC videos in half of the time! Enjoy!

**UPDATE:** My thanks to [Paul Brown][6] who let me know that the native QuickTime player can playback faster, even if it is a little hidden. To increase playback speed, bring up the controls with your mouse, then option-click on the fast-forward control. This will increment playback speed by 10% each time you click. You can keep clicking this up to 2.0x playback speed but sadly the audio does not work at 2.0x, you&#8217;ll have to limit yourself to 1.9x to retain the faster audio. Thanks again for the help Paul!
