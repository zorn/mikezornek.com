This weekend was the second annual [CocoaLove][1] event here in Philadelphia.

> A conference about people, not tech. CocoaLove highlights the iOS/Mac community&#8217;s passions, challenges, and triumphs.

[From all accounts][2], people had a great time. My very heartfelt &#8220;thank you&#8221; to the speakers, attendees and organizers for making it such a blast.

Some of my own takeaways and notes:

- [Just Do It!][3] and more specifically, don&#8217;t let your high taste of quality hold you hostage from creating and shipping. Get it out in the world and improve it over time.
- Don&#8217;t let the negativity of the web infect you. Be positive; be constructive.
- Make time to help people out. Mentor them, teach them, guide them. It&#8217;s probably the most import work you&#8217;ll ever do.
- Embrace today; do what you love; don&#8217;t settle.
- Don&#8217;t let other people define your life&#8217;s scope. [Poke life.][4]
- The world is in desperate need of good managers. Managers need not be robots; the best managers can have a huge impact on their team and the product.
- Don&#8217;t let imposter syndrome or other people hold you back.
- Humanizing the customer support experience is extremely important. These people are calling out for help, treat them right.
- The developer ecosystem is forever changing. Even today the wheels are in motion and a few years from now it&#8217;ll be different. Be prepared for change.
- Embrace side projects. Start tons of things. Experiment. Do things outside your comfort zone.

While we wait for this years talks to be edited and published, consider stopping by the [2014 video collection][5]. In particular I recommend [Joe Cieplinski &#8211; The Back of the Fence][6].
