I&#8217;ve wanted to get better at using Sketch for a while now and it looks like I might get my wish!

![iOS Mobile Design with Sketch][1]

At work we&#8217;ve revamped our mobile design class and it now includes learning Sketch alongside mobile design fundamentals. The [class summary][2]:

> If you have basic design experience in UI, UX, web or responsive web design, this class will teach you to bring your designs to iOS in just five days.
> 
> In this intense week of learning about design for iOS devices, you will design an iOS app, from concept to delivery. With a focus on Sketch, you will learn a process that you can use in any future app design projects.

If this sounds interesting to you I highly encourage you to [register][2] and join us in January. I&#8217;m registered and really looking forward to the class.
