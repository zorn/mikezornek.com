I&#8217;m working on some other posts to recount the history of our CocoaHeads chapter. While brainstorming for it I couldn&#8217;t help but start to capture my own history and how I came to work on the Mac so I figured I&#8217;d write it up and share.

> The following post has a lot of &#8220;Way Back Machine&#8221; links to see sites as they used to be, a fun trip down memory lane.

I didn&#8217;t start learning computer stuff until high school (1995) and even then it was on a 286 using DOS for BASIC and PASCAL. Starting college (1997) I finally got to buy a computer of my own, it was a Windows machine but I didn&#8217;t really mind at the time. After my first year of college I got to take my [co-op experience][1]. Through it I ended up doing web design for a [small company][2] just outside Philly. I got to work with a former Apple employee and he was quick to saturate me in the ways of the Mac. Overall I was impressed and by the end of the co-op was considering a Mac of my own. Now being in college and just having bought a Windows computer I wasn&#8217;t in a financial position to change, but the seeds were planted.

By 2000 I was doing web design part time for [Seybold][3], using a Mac at work and Windows at home. I was getting into the server side of web development, learning about UNIX, Apache, MySQL and the like. Around this time Mac OS X was announced. **The idea of running Photoshop next to Apache pretty much sold me and I knew right then I wanted to participate on this platform.**

> I probably watched Steve [introduce the Aqua UI][4] over a dozen times.

With the 2001 Macworld Keynote came the release of the Titanium PowerBook G4. I got the high end 500 MHz model. I split the cost across two credit cards and some cash. I couldn&#8217;t afford this machine but I had to have it. It was the first personal Mac I ever owned.

Initially I ran Mac OS 9 on my TiBook, but on Saturday March 24, 2001 I drove out into the rain to my local UPS warehouse to pick up the copy of Mac OS X I had ordered (No way I was going to wait until Monday for delivery!). I came home, installed it and never went back.

> Well, technically I did go back to OS 9 on occasion. Some apps like Final Cut Pro (which I was using for my film class) didn&#8217;t work in the Classic environment at all and other apps, well, just worked better booted into 9. That said, I really enjoyed working in OS X. Despite all of its performance issues and bugs I was too busy enjoying all the new stuff: the new UI and the new APIs (my first time programming for a native window UI).

Time moves on, it&#8217;s 2003 or so. By now I&#8217;m a total Apple geek. Regularly reading [As the Apple Turns][5] and [Daring Fireball][6]. I&#8217;m marking my calendar and listening to [Your Mac Life&#8217;s][7] live radio shows. I&#8217;m reading tons of [books about the history of Apple][8].

I&#8217;m now also now looking to connect with other Mac users. I eventually come to join [MacBUS][9] a local Mac User Group focused on the business side of the Mac. I also visit other groups in the area from time to time such as the Main Line Mac User Group&#8217;s Programming Special Interest Group. A fun group but there was little coverage of Cocoa, it was mostly scripting languages like AppleScript and PHP.

It was however through these groups and connections I met Randy Zauhar, a professor at the University of the Science. He and some of his students were working in Cocoa and wanted to start a regular meetup. We called it [PHAD, Philadelphia Apple Developers][10].

And that&#8217;s it for now. I&#8217;ll recount more of PHAD and how it eventually lead into Philly CocoaHeads in my next post.
