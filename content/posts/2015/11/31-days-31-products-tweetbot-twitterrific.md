## Day 07: TweetBot & Twitterrific

> This post is part of [a larger series][1] where for 31 days I&#8217;m posting a story about a particular product or service I&#8217;ve come to enjoy.

Doing a two for one special today (Cyber Monday and all!) with two of my favorite Twitter clients.

For me, the only reason I found Twitter usable and joined in 2007 was because of [Twitterrific for Mac OS X][2]. There was no way I was going to visit the Twitter website to stay active but the idea of having my timeline live on my desktop was a killer feature, and thus a killer app.

Later on iOS, I with many others experienced an orgy of Twitter app options. I personally favored Tweetie but after that was bought and killed by Twitter itself I moved on to [TweetBot][3].

> Random aside, it&#8217;s a real shame that TweetBot has given up so much of its [historic personality / UI identity][4] to fit in within the new iOS aesthetic. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I still love the features set of the app, but the current version has very little personality compared to its early days.

I do prefer TweetBot on the phone, but when it comes to my iPad I&#8217;m back to Twitterrific. While a bit bulky to look at, I just love the full screen view of my timeline.
