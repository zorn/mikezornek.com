At [CocoaLove 2015][1] we had the pleasure of listening to [Jaimee Newberry][2] speak and from [my notes][3] I recollect the following from her talk:

> [Just Do It!][4] and more specifically, donâ€™t let your high taste of quality hold you hostage from creating and shipping. Get it out into the world and improve it over time.

Even before the talk, I was already inspired by Jaimee&#8217;s &#8220;31 days&#8221; series of [writings][5] and [video posts][6]. I&#8217;ve been wanting to get more writing practice and have been kicking the can on starting my own series but no more!

Today begins **31 Days, 31 Products** &#8212; a blog series where once a day for 31 days I&#8217;ll post a short story sharing some of the products and services I&#8217;ve come to enjoy using. I hope you like it and discover a new helpful tool along the way.
