## Day 02: Fin

> This post is part of [a larger series][1] where for 31 days I&#8217;m posting a story about a particular product or service I&#8217;ve come to enjoy.

[Fin][2] is an app for iOS that turns your device into a large countdown timer; particularly helpful for presentations and performances. Fin is a universal app that works well for iPad as well as iPhone. It even has ï£¿Watch support.

I&#8217;ve been using Fin via an iPad mini at [CocoaHeads][3] and it really helps us stay on time with our busy agenda. I really like the color warnings when time is running out and generally how easy it is to reset / change times with gestures.

Fin is available from the [App Store][4] for $4.99 and you can find out more about it on [its website][2].
