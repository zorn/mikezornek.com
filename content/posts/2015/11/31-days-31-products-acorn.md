## Day 04: Acorn

> This post is part of [a larger series][1] where for 31 days I&#8217;m posting a story about a particular product or service I&#8217;ve come to enjoy.

[Acorn][2] is an image editor for Mac OS X built with tons of love, from the native UI that feels like it truly belongs on Mac OS X to some of the most impressive [documentation][3] and [tutorials][4] you&#8217;ll find. When you choose Acorn you&#8217;re getting a first class product.

I&#8217;ve been a long time Acorn user. I find it&#8217;s much quicker to open and do some quick image cropping or color adjustments than some other monster app like Photoshop. I&#8217;ve also made use of it&#8217;s excellent scripting features before to automate screenshot processing and the like. It&#8217;s a huge time saver.

Acorn has a [free trial available][6] on it&#8217;s website and when you are ready to buy you can [buy direct][7] or via the [Mac App Store][8]. A license will cost you $29.99.
