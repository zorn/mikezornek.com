I started reading books from the Pragmatic Programmers back when I started learning about Rails 1.0 and over the years have built up quite a significant library from them.

They are having their [annual Thanksgiving sale][1], 40% off all ebooks (code &#8220;turkeysale2015&#8221;). A great time to load up for some holiday reading.

My recommendation this year is [The Nature of Software Development][2]. It shares many core values I have about software development. It&#8217;s a short read with lots of quirky sketches. I highly recommend it.

There was also [a talk at ETE from Ron][3] about the book but I&#8217;ll continue to recommend the book itself more as I think it&#8217;s a little more focused, better value for your time.
