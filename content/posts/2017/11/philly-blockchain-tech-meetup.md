Local geek friend [Ben DiFrancescÂ­o][1] is starting up a new meetup called [Philly Blockchain Tech][2]:

> Don&#8217;t miss the first ever meeting of Philly Blockchain Tech! Special thanks to our gracious hosts, Elsevier, for providing the space, food, and beverages!
>
> Pizza and drinks will be served at 6:00 PM. At roughly 6:30, we&#8217;ll hear two brief talks from our organizers. In addition to introducing the group, sponsors, and thoughts for the future, Ben will discuss &#8220;Why Technologists and Entrepreneurs Should be Excited About Blockchain&#8221; and Ryan will present &#8220;A Look at the Cryptocurrency Landscape&#8221; from a developer&#8217;s point of view.
>
> After the talks, we&#8217;ll leave time for open discussion about the meetup. We want to hear from you about how you&#8217;d like to see this meetup evolve and what you&#8217;re hoping to get from it! Any remaining time will be for socializing and open conversation.
>
> Please share this event with anyone you know who might find this interesting! While we hope to focus on technology and entrepreneurship, we welcome people with all experience levels and professional backgrounds!

[RSVP if you plan to attend!][3]
