As I alluded to after [loosing my job][1] at the end of January, I knew I&#8217;d take the majority of February to [recover from my neck surgery][2] and then get serious about work in March. We&#8217;ll it&#8217;s almost the end of March so I figured I&#8217;d do an update.

First, welcome [Zorn Labs LLC][3], my new company. It will house my future consulting and product work.

Second, I am still looking for work. My goal is to find something 10-30 hours a week, doing iOS or iOS mentoring. To help express my skill set and goals I&#8217;ll point you to the [new company site][3]. I would appreciate all friends and followers to help spread the word.

Outside of setting up the new business and website, much of March has been spent towards marketing and planning. I had many lunches and coffees with prospects and friends. I even had a few offers but they sadly weren&#8217;t the right fit for me at this time. When I haven&#8217;t been marketing I&#8217;ve been trying to jumpstart some new web skills, refreshing my [HTML5/CSS3 knowledge][4], getting deeper into [Hugo][5] template design for the [new Philly CocoaHead website][6], and experimenting with [Elixir][7] and [Phoenix][8].

For those interested in my Mac app project, you can also check out my project journal blog at: <http://restedexperience.com>. I&#8217;ve been trying to update that a little more often with my recent progress.

So that&#8217;s my March update. Thanks for the interest! More to come in April! ðŸ™‚
