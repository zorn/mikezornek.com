When I re-entered the self-employed world last March and launched [Zorn Labs LLC][1] one of my main goals was to find a way to continue my education work. The first output of this effort has been workshops, specifically one on Refactoring iOS.

I&#8217;ve developed and taught the workshop for a local development studio [Tonic Design][2] and am now going to run it publicly.

> [iOS Refactoring Workshop][3]
>
> Throwing away bad code and writing something new from scratch is both risky and expensive. You need to avoid this temptation and instead learn to master small improvements over time.
>
> Refactoring is the art of improving code without changing user behavior. Adding dedicated refactoring time to your workflow and sprints can pay for itself many times over in both added source code flexibility and application stability.
>
> In this workshop we will review refactoring concepts from a high level and then explore example cases found in many iOS projects. As a group we&#8217;ll refactor and discuss the benefits of our changes. We&#8217;ll then work on our own (or in pairs) to execute what we&#8217;ve learned and then demonstrate the results for the class.
>
> This workshop is targeted at those iOS developers who are getting over the hump of learning iOS and now want to know how to write higher quality iOS code. This workshop is capped at 12 people to make sure there is plenty of time for questions and individual attention.

Tickets for the half day workshop cost $189.00 even (we take care of all the ticketing fees). For more information on the agenda, see [the event page][3].
