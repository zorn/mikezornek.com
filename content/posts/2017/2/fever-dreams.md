While I had hopes of doing more productive things, I ended up spending the last few days in bed fighting off a pretty lousy sinus / chest cold.

Between the medicines and the fever, I don&#8217;t think I had more than 90 consecutive minutes of sleep. The dreams were awful too. Not like vivid/scary but it was as if I&#8217;m trying to solve an algebra problem and the rules don&#8217;t make sense. Sometimes I had these really long dreams and then I&#8217;d wake up only to find I was asleep for an hour or so.

Nothing like being sick to help remind you to appreciate the importance of your health.

Anyways, I&#8217;m on the mend and taking some antibiotics to help make sure my system is clean for Friday&#8217;s neck surgery. I&#8217;m hopeful the recovery of that will be easier than this past weekend. I think it should be.

On Thursday we&#8217;ve got [CocoaHeads][1]! I&#8217;ll be there to MC but will probably take it easy at the bar afterwords for obvious reasons.

Finally, I want to take a quick moment to say thanks to everyone who reached out to me regarding my [unemployment news from last week][2]. I really appreciate the well wishes and leads. Getting that kind of response really helps put my stress at ease. Thanks so much.
