I am no longer an employee of Big Nerd Ranch. The news came down on Monday. I can&#8217;t speak to any of the details but suffice to say I am disappointed. I really enjoyed working at BNR. My time there was productive, for my own personal growth as well as that of my students and clients. I wish them well, and continue to recommend them as a good source for iOS education.

So, what&#8217;s next for me?

On the immediate horizon, I&#8217;m a bit focused on my neck surgery, which is on Feb 10th. Its been scheduled since November. The goal is to remove a large cyst on the back of my neck. I will be put under for this surgery, so tomorrow I have to get a bunch of blood work and X-rays done.

For work, I open to ideas. Generally speaking I&#8217;m unlikely to make long term plans and would probably prefer to take on some smaller consulting work. I&#8217;d like to steep a bit on my long term options. If you have anyone who might be in need for an experienced iOS or Mac developer, [let me know][1]. Thanks for your help.
