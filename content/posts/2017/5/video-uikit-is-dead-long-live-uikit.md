[Philly CocoaHeads][1] held a joint meetup with our Android friends for Philly Tech Week. At said meetup there were a bunch of lightning talks, and I did one.

> UIKit is Dead, Long Live UIKit!
>
> With the introduction of Swift and the rise of functional programming ideals in the community, UIKit and its MVC heritage has become a bottleneck for new ideas. This talk speculates how Apple might overcome this in the years to come. Attendee should walk away with a curiosity about the other UI patterns being developed and a resource list to learn more.

I actually had a few vocal flubs in the recording (was a little stressed about the 10 minute limit) but figured I&#8217;d use the live one anyways since it has more humanity than me speaking to myself in my room. I hope you enjoy!
