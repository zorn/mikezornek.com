Today I&#8217;m launching the teaser site for my new app, [OwlDeck][1].

> OwlDeck is a new macOS presentation tool for programmers and geeks who need to display code and love Markdown.

If you are interested in OwlDeck I&#8217;d love for you to signup to its newsletter and [email me your thoughts][2].

If you are interested in some behinds the scene stuff you can checkout the project journal I&#8217;ve been keeping over at [Rested Experience][3]. I hope to share more now that things are going public and timelines are set.

Really excited to be working on products again. ðŸ™‚
