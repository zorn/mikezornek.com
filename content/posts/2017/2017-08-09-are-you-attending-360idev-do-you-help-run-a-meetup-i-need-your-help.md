I&#8217;ll be attending 360iDev next week and am giving the following talk on meetups:

> **[Starting, Growing and Running a Successful Developer Meetup][1]**
> 
> One of the most rewarding aspects of my career has been attending and then helping to run my local Apple developer meetup group. Meetup groups provide great learning opportunities but more importantly they provide great relationship opportunities for its members. In this talk I’ll share the story and lessons learned from running my local CocoaHeads chapter. After a quick review of the benefits and challenges of running a local developer group we’ll jump into actionable items for people starting, growing or running their own group. From defining success, to time expectations, marketing, sponsorship, planning content, tools and more. **To close the session we’ll invite a few other group leaders from the audience to the front for a broad question and answer session about your specific issues and concerns.** This talk is targeted at those who are running or would like to run a local developer meetup. It may also be helpful to those who attend a current group that needs guidance and/or focus.

Per the description, I&#8217;m planning for some question and answer time at the end. I think it might be helpful to have some other meetup organizers there to introduce themselves and give their own perspectives to questions. If you are attending and would like to make yourself available, [let me know][2]. Thanks.
