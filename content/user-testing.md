# A developer-focused, Remote User Testing Session of your mobile app or website, for $299

## What is user testing?

User testing is a form of usability research where you:

1. Give a person your mobile app and some basic tasks.
2. Ask them to talk out loud while they perform the tasks.
3. Sit quietly, observe and take notes about what is working and what is not.

In general, it is a good idea to regularly perform user testing to challenge assumptions and learn for real world experiences.

## The current challenge

Right now it is much harder to run these user tests.

* People are avoiding unnecessary travel.
* People don’t want to stand next to or talk with strangers.
* People don’t want to handle other people’s phones.
* Many people are unsure how to screen share or record their iPhone or Android screens.

## The pitch

A developer-focused, Remote User Testing Session of your mobile app or website for $299.
