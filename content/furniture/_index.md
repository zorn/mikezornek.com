# Furniture

I'll be moving in the fall and am getting rid of a few items of furniture. 

If you or anyone you know would get value from them, **and** can come to pick them up (I can not help with removal or transport) you are welcome to them.

## Recliner

Heavily used but still in working condition. Plugs in to the wall for a powered adjustment.

## Coffee Table

Heavy wood coffee table that has some drawers. The top open up to be a bit of a table when needed.

## Bedroom Dresser with Mirror

Dark wood. Six drawers. Few years old but in great condition. Comes with attached mirror.
