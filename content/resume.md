description: |
    As a software developer with 25 years of experience building and selling digital products, I seek a full-time tech lead / principal-level job opportunity to guide and nurture a team that delivers customer-led products. My peers describe me as a detail-oriented and pragmatic project manager with deep technical skills. I am excited about joining or assembling a team that can deliver products they are proud of and that solve real problems. Open-source projects and upstream contributions opportunities are a notable plus.

    In recent years, my technical stack has primarily been Elixir, Phoenix, and LiveView to deliver web software and APIs. These are wonderful technologies, and while I will continue to use them, I am open to other stacks for the right fit. Other timely experiences have included Rust and Svelte and a history building for Apple platforms.
