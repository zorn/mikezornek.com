## Personal

Doing good. In a fairly uneventful and quiet stride right now -- which I enjoy. Very much enjoying the cooler temps and open windows. Still not walking / exercising like I need to.

## Work

Working full time for [Allovue](https://www.allovue.com/) (since Dec 2023) doing full stack [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Phoenix LiveView](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) web development. Allovue provides accounting software for K-12 school districts.

With the pitch of a small company (~50 people) and a good culture fit, I joined Allovue in December of 2023. Six weeks after joining Allovue was [acquired by PowerSchool][1], and now PowerSchool is going to be [acquired by private equity firm Bain Capital][2].

It is very foggy how things will land with so much change going on. I am giving my long-term future a lot of thought right now and am [open to new opportunities](/resume).

## Side Projects

Working on a LiveView app that does ranked voting called [Flick](https://github.com/zorn/flick). I successfully used Flick to do a ranked vote for Elixir Book Club. Hoping to do a UX pass on it over the next month or so.

Starting to brainstorm what kind of project I want to work on after Flick. Thinking about customer success software, something that merges support and analytics.

Attending and helping with minimal admin duties for [Elixir Book Club](https://elixirbookclub.github.io/website/). Recently pushed a new version of the website and some Discord changes. We just started reading [Elixir Patterns](https://elixirpatterns.dev/).

Been penciling out a possible new gaming PC, ahead of Civ7 (due in February). Not sure if I want to buy or build.
