## Personal

The new year is in full swing. Who knew it was February already?

Philly is still bitter cold, mostly. Some snow on the ground again as I type this. I'm very anxious for the return to spring and getting my windows open again. Morning walks outside would be nice too.

Big Philly news, of course, is the Super Bowl win. Can't wait to see the city enjoy the parade and festivities on Friday.

Me? I've been ok. Getting some personal projects moving along and doing the everyday adult things like keeping the house in order. 

Civilization 7, the game that was a notable reason to build my gaming computer, was released and is... undercooked. I'm enjoying getting to know the game, but they will need a few more patches before it is enjoyable to the masses. It has made me think about some of the design decisions in Civ6 with a new appreciation.

## Work

I currently work full time for [Allovue](https://www.allovue.com/) doing full stack [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Phoenix LiveView](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) web development. Allovue provides accounting software for K-12 school districts.

I joined Allovue in December of 2023, but after two acquisitions, many of the things I joined for are gone. 

I've started promoting my own [Elixir Consulting](https://mikezornek.com/elixir-consulting/) and am attempting to return to consulting in 2025.

## Side Projects

Flick work is starting to close, and I am actively investigating what is next.

I wrote a blog post about [local-first software](https://mikezornek.com/posts/2025/2/what-is-local-first-software/), and I think a scoped research project is on the horizon.
