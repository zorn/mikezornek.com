## Personal

Getting over COVID. Testing negative again, but still suffering with some shortness of breath and a light cough. I'd say I'm at 90% right now.

Feeling more productive after some down days over the summer. Enjoying having the windows open again.

## Work

Working full time for [Allovue](https://www.allovue.com/) (since Dec 2023) doing full stack [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Phoenix LiveView](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) web development. Allovue provides accounting software for K-12 school districts.

With the pitch of a small company (~50 people) and a good culture fit, I joined Allovue in December of 2023. Six weeks after joining Allovue was [acquired by PowerSchool][1], and now PowerSchool is going to be [acquired by private equity firm Bain Capital][2].

It is very foggy how things will land with so much change going on. I am giving my long-term future a lot of thought right now and am [open to new opportunities](/resume).

## Side Projects

Working on a LiveView app that does ranked voting called [Flick](https://github.com/zorn/flick).

Attending and helping with minimal admin duties for [Elixir Book Club](https://elixirbookclub.com/) (where we will use Flick to help pick our next book).
