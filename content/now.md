## What is a Now page?

I like to think of a Now page as the things I'd share if you were an old friend and we saw each other and were asking, what's going on? What are you working on? What are you excited about?

## Personal

Doing better as of late. Feel like July and August were down months with not much going well. In September things are getting back into a good rhythm with some client consulting work and otherwise productive days.

## Work

I found a new consulting client and have been onboarding for the last few weeks. It is a kitchen software platform, dealing with order capture (online and kiosk), kitchen management, fulfillment, and delivery. Bunch of new things to learn. It is mostly just me, which is kind of unfortunate (I'd love more people to interact with day-to-day), but I have some limited access to a previous developer for guidance and review.

Most of the work to date has been basic maintenance updates and testing work. Have also been doing some work adjacent to get a Grafana/Prometheus setup working on my side project Flick (which ideally, I'd repurpose here as well).

## Side Projects

My side project work has come to a crawl (minus the Grafana/Prometheus stuff mentioned). I'm not really sure what I want to pour my attention into right now.

## Currently Playing

I've been playing a lot of Civ 6 over the summer, but am starting to consider other games. This weekend I started Sea of Stars (which I bought a while ago). I also pre-ordered Final Fantasy Tactics remake. I have a mixed history with FFT, but curious to give it a new try. I have a Red Dead 2 game in progress that I play on occasion (mid Chapter 4), and also playing MLB: The Show a bit, but less in the last few weeks.

## Currently Reading
