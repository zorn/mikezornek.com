## Personal

Things are... so-so.

Been kind of coasting, waiting for the holiday break, and it is now here. 

I have off for about a week and a half. A few family events, but overall will have the time to myself.

A successful break would include finishing up some improvements I have in mind for [Flick](https://github.com/zorn/flick). I have some new project ideas on the horizon and it would be nice to leave Flick in a good place.

Also hoping to use the free time to get in some morning walks and audiobooks. I need to exercise more. I feel the extra weight from a very stagnant last few months. 

Lots of thoughts in my head about the future. Very much worried about the state of the US, the economy, etc., but trying to find some space to focus on personal improvements.

Taking job risks in times like this is scary, but the status quo feels unacceptable.

## Work

Currently, working full time for [Allovue](https://www.allovue.com/) doing full stack [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Phoenix LiveView](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) web development. Allovue provides accounting software for K-12 school districts.

With the pitch of a small company (~50 people) and a good culture fit, I joined Allovue in December of 2023. Six weeks after joining Allovue was [acquired by PowerSchool][1], and now PowerSchool has been [acquired by private equity firm Bain Capital][2].

I've started to organize my own [Elixir consulting pitch](https://mikezornek.com/elixir-consulting/) and will try to find a way to return to consulting in 2025.

## Side Projects

Have had a few light coding sessions working on [Flick](https://github.com/zorn/flick) in recent weeks, but nothing to write home about. 

Enjoying the fruits of my gaming PC build. Ended up rolling a gnome mage and a few alts on the new World of Warcraft Classic servers. Very casual at the moment. My mage is level 24 or so.
