## What is a Now page?

I like to think of a Now page as the things I'd share if you were an old friend and we saw each other and were asking, what's going on? What are you working on? What are you excited about?

## Personal

Just returned from a few nice days down the shore with my sister. Despite a questionable forecast, we ended up with some nice weather and good beach days. I love getting beat up by the waves, resting in the sun, and repeating. Did not get much beach book reading done, but good vibes to clear my head.

Vacation time is a great reset, and I look forward to returning to work refreshed and revived.

## Currently Snacking On

My beach candy of choice was 3 Musketeers. I have a few left over.

## Work

Finished up some small gig work and currently looking for a more meaty [elixir consulting](/elixir-consulting/) project. I'm mainly focused on blog content publishing and other community interactions to help create space for more personal introductions. Over time, I'll have to expand this and maybe even suspend my 32-hour per week limit (which is in place to allow me to have some personal investment time).

## Side Projects

I'm interested in the possibility of building some side-project software for the audience of digital product builders. Specifically, I'm thinking about customer communication and success tooling. Right now, I'm spending a little time looking at various tools and watering holes to understand the landscape better.

Blog infrastructure upgrades continue but are slowing. Still interested in doing some more old Vimeo video migrations and introducing tags for blog content.

## Currently Playing

- Red Dead 2 (doing lots of side quests, finishing up chapter 2)
- Stardew Valley (just started Year 1 Fall on my newest farm)
- MLB: The Show 2025 -- Been keeping up with live content and enjoying it. Avoiding the pay-to-win packs and consuming the normal content.

## Currently Reading

- [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/buy.html) (for [book club](https://elixirbookclub.github.io/website/))
- [Ash Framework](https://pragprog.com/titles/ldash/ash-framework/) (doing this at my computer and typing out all the things to really get my head around things)
- [Traction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25768015-traction) (to help me plan marketing efforts of upcoming side project work)
