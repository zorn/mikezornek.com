## Personal

I'm numb from the election. Trying as much as possible not to think about it too much.

Even before the election outcome, I've been kind of down for the last few weeks. 

Treading water, keeping up with adulting but not enjoying the little things as much as I want to.

## Work

Working full time for [Allovue](https://www.allovue.com/) (since Dec 2023) doing full stack [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Phoenix LiveView](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) web development. Allovue provides accounting software for K-12 school districts.

With the pitch of a small company (~50 people) and a good culture fit, I joined Allovue in December of 2023. Six weeks after joining Allovue was [acquired by PowerSchool][1], and now PowerSchool has been [acquired by private equity firm Bain Capital][2].

It is very foggy how things will land with so much change going on. I am giving my long-term future a lot of thought right now.

## Side Projects

Invested multiple weekends on multiple office projects. 

First was the assembly of my new motorized standing desk. Took a while to get together, and in hindsight, I probably should have paid for assembly but oh wells. The desk is nice. I don't stand too often, usually during phone calls. Took the time to clean up some wiring when putting all the gear back in place.

Second was the assembly of my new gaming PC. This took about three days of part-time work. I have not assembled a PC in 8 years or so and it took a lot of time to make sure I was doing it right. I may do a deeper blog on the project soon.

Have not given much time to [Flick](https://github.com/zorn/flick) in recent weeks but it remains something I want to clean up and close as 1.0.
