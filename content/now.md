## What is a Now page?

I like to think of a Now page as the things I'd share if you were an old friend and we saw each other and were asking, what's going on? What are you working on? What are you excited about?

## Personal

Nervous excitement about [moving on from my previous full-time job](/posts/2025/5/returning-to-self-employment/).

Generally, there have been more positive vibes lately. I am a little worried about how I might use and misuse the upcoming excessive free time. Trying hard to block off time and set daily/weekly goals.

Enjoying the baseball season. It is a wonderful distraction, even with a shaky bullpen.

World news is still very concerning, but trying to avoid letting it saturate my attention and do good work with the tools I am given.

## Currently Snacking On

Easter candy leftovers.

## Work

[Looking for consulting work](/elixir-consulting/) is a big priority day-to-day. Doing a mix of cold outreach, preparing to publish Elixir content in the weeks ahead, and otherwise trying to make space for good happenstance.

## Side Projects

I'm interested in the possibility of building some side-project software for the audience of digital product builders. Specifically, I'm thinking about customer success tooling. Right now, I'm spending a little time looking at various tools and watering holes to understand the landscape better.

This pivot from some notebook / journaling / [local-first](/posts/2025/2/what-is-local-first-software/) interests is primarily driven by money. I saw that project as more of an education / personal-itch to scratch and in the moment I a bit more paranoid about money so would like to prefer business-to-business app ideas where revenue (while still a long shot) feels more approachable.  

Blog upgrades continue but are slowing. Still interested in doing some more old Vimeo video migrations and introducing tags for blog content. 

Otherwise, my main side projects right now are learning projects:

- Finishing up [Engineering Elixir Applications](https://pragprog.com/titles/beamops/engineering-elixir-applications/) for book club. Hoping to take some of the lessons learned and better package my upcoming side projects for self-hosting interests.
- Reading through [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/svelte/welcome-to-svelte) docs as I would like to use it for some more complex frontend components, even in my LiveView work.
- Planning to work through a [web accessibility](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/accessibility-v3/) course.
