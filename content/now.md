## Personal

After an enjoyable and restful holiday break, this week saw the return to normalcy.

It is frightfully cold right now in Philadelphia, and running the heat is killing my dry skin. Finally went and got the humidifiers out of storage and cleaned up to help out.

And while I try to stay warm I dream of springtime and baseball. Tonight I watched the [Phillies video yearbook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdgCwLGs6rQ). I was fortunate enough to be at many of the games showcased, including Rhys Hoskins' homecoming, Cole Hammels' retirement night, and the night they clinched the east. Of course, it was a bitter end in October, but still many great memories. Can't wait for the new year.

## Work

I currently work full time for [Allovue](https://www.allovue.com/) doing full stack [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Phoenix LiveView](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) web development. Allovue provides accounting software for K-12 school districts.

I joined Allovue in December of 2023, but after two acquisitions, many of the things I joined for are gone. 

I've started to promote my own [Elixir consulting](https://mikezornek.com/elixir-consulting/) and am attempting a return to consulting in 2025.

## Side Projects

I did not finish [Flick](https://github.com/zorn/flick) during the holiday break as I had hoped but I did make some progress. I have some things to clean up over the next two days before I'll be using the app to run the next ranked vote for Elixir Book Club.

Also actively reading up on some event-sourcing and Conflict-free Replicated Datatypes (CRDTs) for possible next project ideas.
