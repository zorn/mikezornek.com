## Personal

Doing well. Normal vibes day to day. Missing Phillies baseball, but still watching the playoffs. The Dodgers game one world series win last night was impressive. 

Did a few walks over the past month and renewed my Audible membership with some new books. Hoping they will keep me honest and interested in those morning walks.

After a month of ongoing research, I pulled the trigger on a new gaming PC build. Components are all ordered and I should start assembly next week. Big games I have in mind include: Read Dead 2 (with mods), Civ 6 and Civ 7 (February), Wow and/or FF 14, Stardew Valley (would like to get back and finish my last farm I started with 1.6).

Also purchased a new standup desk for my office (the old desk will be moved across the room for the gaming PC). Still not done office updates, and expect to order some new office lighting soon along with more desk things.

## Work

Working full time for [Allovue](https://www.allovue.com/) (since Dec 2023) doing full stack [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Phoenix LiveView](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) web development. Allovue provides accounting software for K-12 school districts.

With the pitch of a small company (~50 people) and a good culture fit, I joined Allovue in December of 2023. Six weeks after joining Allovue was [acquired by PowerSchool][1], and now PowerSchool is going to be [acquired by private equity firm Bain Capital][2].

It is very foggy how things will land with so much change going on. I am giving my long-term future a lot of thought right now and am [open to new opportunities](/resume).

## Side Projects

Working on a LiveView app that does ranked voting called [Flick](https://github.com/zorn/flick). I successfully used Flick to do a ranked vote for Elixir Book Club. Hoping to do a UX pass on it over the next month or so.

Starting to brainstorm what kind of project I want to work on after Flick. Thinking about customer success software, something that merges support and analytics.

Attending and helping with minimal admin duties for [Elixir Book Club](https://elixirbookclub.github.io/website/). Recently pushed a new version of the website and some Discord changes. We are reading [Elixir Patterns](https://elixirpatterns.dev/) and will read [Elixir in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action-third-edition) next.
