## What is a Now page?

I like to think of a Now page as the kind of things I'd share if you were an old friend and we saw each other and were asking, what's going on? What you working on? What you excited about?

You can find more info here too: <https://nownownow.com/about>

## Personal

Been kind of down as of late if I'm honest. I'm sure everyone has ups and downs, even in good times, but real world things are adding on to those normal waves as of late.

Enjoying the start of baseball season. It is a wonderful distraction.

## Work

Still working full time for [Allovue](https://www.allovue.com/) doing full stack [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Phoenix LiveView](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) web development -- but actively looking to return to [consulting](https://mikezornek.com/elixir-consulting/). If you have any project leads let me know.

## Side Projects

I wrote a blog post about [local-first software](https://mikezornek.com/posts/2025/2/what-is-local-first-software/), and am about to start a scoped research project related to it.

I think it might be a hybrid notebook/todo/habits/time-tracker to match my very opinionated style of life organization. Currently I solve this with a mix of OmniFocus and Obsidian but I think it could be neat to bring it all together. The time tracking is not something I do much of today but I think it would be helpful to be more strict in tracking these things to see improvements over time.

Early work has been mostly research and reading. Did spend a session tinkering with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) which is a tool I'd like to consider as a wrapper of a primarily Svelte-based UI app. Not sure I'm aligned to coding the core in Rust, as the tool provides, since I'd also like some kind of web-share version as well. Will likely focus on pure Svelte things in the short term, and draft bigger plans later.

I also have some plans for some website updates too:

- Want to get Tailwind working here so I can start some redesign things.
- Start packaging the site as a Docker image which would allow me to use a different Hugo version than Render.com currently supports.
- More tag use and possibly introduce a more localized search tool.

## Currently Playing

* MLB: The Show 2025 -- Enjoying the early grind. I still suck against other humans.
* Civilization 7 -- Have finally started to install mods which are making the game much more usable.
* I may give [Lunar Silver Star Story](https://www.lunarremastered.com/) some time when it comes out. I really enjoyed the Playstation 1 version back in the day. Could be a good use of my Steam Deck.

## Currently Reading

* [Engineering Elixir Applications](https://pragprog.com/titles/beamops/engineering-elixir-applications/) (for [book club](https://elixirbookclub.github.io/website/))
* [Ash Framework](https://pragprog.com/titles/ldash/ash-framework/)

## Currently Watching

* Peaky Blinders (season 3)
* Seinfeld (season 4)

## Upcoming Events

Not much on the horizon. 

Probably go to a Phillies game soon. I also have a shore trip planned for June.
