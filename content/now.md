## What is a Now page?

I like to think of a Now page as the things I'd share if you were an old friend and we saw each other and were asking, what's going on? What are you working on? What are you excited about?

## Personal

Feeling ok. Not in a particularly productive mindset, but not as down as I was during parts of the summer. This mindset is mostly fueled through gaming distractions during my off hours. While not ideal, I've been pretty content with "distracted" over down so, 🤷‍♂️.

## Work

Been working a part-time maintenance contract for the last few months. Going well overall, but I am (for the most part) the only developer, so it is lonely work. Additionally, there is the challenge of learning a new code base, one inherited from a company that went out of business, and presents all the challenges one might expect. For now, the servers are running, and while some bugs are popping up, nothing too scary is happening. I expect this to stay the status quo while the upper management figures out what they want to do long-term.

## Side Projects

Nothing, and that is not good. One reason I justify a part-time contract is to invest in my own side projects, but I have not found an idea that pulls me in. It is so awkward being a software developer who believes the world needs less software.

## Currently Playing

I (re)started leveling a Mage in World of Warcraft Classic that I created last year. I was excited about the upcoming re-release of The Burning Crusade, but my excitement has waned a little bit since I found out they will be launching with a significantly nerfed version. I'm probably not going to find the challenging heroics and raids I was looking forward to. If the place becomes a brainless loot piñata, I'm not sure it will hold my interest. The expansion itself probably won't release until Feb 2026, so plenty of time to hit classic level cap (60) and goof off.

## Currently Reading

My reading time has dropped drastically in the last few months. I am still chipping away at [Consider the Lobster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consider_the_Lobster), but that is pretty much it. Even my Elixir Book Club is on hiatus until 2026.
