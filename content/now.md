## What is a Now page?

I like to think of a Now page as the things I'd share if you were an old friend and we saw each other and were asking, what's going on? What are you working on? What are you excited about?

## Personal

General emotions are still very mixed. There are some good days but also some bad ones. On the whole I think it is trending in a positive direction but current events scare the crap out of me. Seems evitable we'll crash any minute -- but what else can I do but try to better myself and my situation while the chaos wave approaches. 

"I'm tired of living in an Onion headline" was an accurate quote I saw the other day. 

Enjoying the baseball season. It is a wonderful distraction even with a shaky bullpen.

## Currently Snacking On

Raisinets

## Work

Currently working full time for [Allovue](https://www.allovue.com/) doing full stack [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Phoenix LiveView](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) web development -- but actively looking to return to [consulting](https://mikezornek.com/elixir-consulting/). If you have any project leads let me know.

## Side Projects

I'm currently doing a bunch of life journaling and debating future side projects. Doing exploratory technical research into [local-first software](/posts/2025/2/what-is-local-first-software/), TypeScript, Svelte, Rust, and Tauri. Need to do more discovery around audience and their pain. A few weeks ago, I was content to do this as an education-focused project, but more so as of late (with job/economy stress) has me more interested in revenue-generating ideas.

I did spend a few sessions doing some website improvements and made a point to blog some [about](/posts/2025/4/custom-fonts-without-google/) [them](/posts/2025/4/modern-hugo-on-render-static-site/) to get double value from the time spent. Also did a post on my [expense tracking](/posts/2025/4/google-sheets-expense-budgeting/). Feels great to blog regularly.

I expect to continue updating the blog infrastructure. I'm interested in getting some better search working, more content pages, revamping the consulting page, and [more](https://github.com/zorn/mikezornek.com/issues). 

## Currently Playing

* MLB: The Show 2025 -- Been keeping up with live content and enjoying it. There are still excessive pay-for-packs that annoy me, but I'm making due with the standard content.
* Civilization 7 -- Have not played much in the last few weeks but am likely to return to see how the 1.2 update is. The last game I did play I finally starting installing some mods, and they help a lot.
* I may give [Lunar Silver Star Story](https://www.lunarremastered.com/) some time soon on my Steam Deck. I enjoyed the Playstation 1 version back in the day.

## Currently Reading

* [Engineering Elixir Applications](https://pragprog.com/titles/beamops/engineering-elixir-applications/) (for [book club](https://elixirbookclub.github.io/website/))
