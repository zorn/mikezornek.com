## How I want to work

I am interested in sharing as I go -- but do want to acknowledge this is more about connecting with other founders for personal support than promiting opening as a company culture, think Buffer blog posts about the company vs personal blog posts.

I would love to do more with open source. This is not a hard requirement for all of the project source but it would be nice to consider open source as a default.

* **More customer research.** OwlDeck and Guildflow were very much built to scratch a personal itch. Historically I've had luck with this approach, considering my success with [ProfitTrain] and [Dex] -- but frankly there is too much risk with this approach. For my next project I want to do much more customer research and prioritize profitability / sustainability over personal usage. This isn't to say I will work with any audience, I still need to feel at home but I don't think it is mandatory that I would use the software on a day-to-day basis myself.

* **Faster learning.** OwlDeck and Guildflow both suffered from large scope, new technologies (for me at the time) and were developed on a part-time basis with a very casual momentum. Thinking about my next project, I need to learn faster, and that likely will mean less product scope, working with technologies I have experience with and possibly a full time effort. Still debating what that looks like but I think it would be helpful to get a solid block of time, a minimum of four full-time months I can dedicate to this project.
