    <h2>Objective</h2>

    <p>My name is Mike Zornek, and I am a software developer with <strong>25 years</strong> of experience building and
        selling digital products.</p>

    <p>I seek a <strong>full-time tech lead / principal-level job</strong> opportunity to guide and nurture a team
        delivering <strong>customer-led products</strong>. My peers describe me as a <strong>detail-oriented</strong>
        and <strong>pragmatic project manager</strong> with deep technical skills. I am excited about joining or
        assembling a team that can deliver products they are <strong>proud</strong> of and that solve
        <strong>real</strong>
        problems. Open-source projects and upstream contributions opportunities are a notable plus.

    <h2>Proficiencies</h2>

    <p>In recent years, my technical stack has primarily been <strong>Elixir</strong>, <strong>Phoenix</strong>, and
        <strong>LiveView</strong> to deliver web software and APIs. These are wonderful technologies, and while I will
        continue to use them, I am open to other stacks for the right fit. Other timely experiences have included
        <strong>Rust</strong> and <strong>Svelte</strong> and a history building for <strong>Apple platforms</strong>.

    <h2>Testimonials</h2>

    <blockquote class="testimonial" cite="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikezornek/">

        Michael's worked with us on multiple projects as a fractional engineering leader and I couldn't recommend him
        more highly. He's excellent at working with non-technical stakeholders and junior engineers alike, he's a great
        engineer, and a deep appreciation for context permeates all the work he does. He's also a really nice guy and
        very easy to work with. You should work with Mike if you get the chance.

            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF3llh4VLlQ">YouTube</a> &mdash; This talk is for people
            curious about
            the basics of GitHub Actions and how they can utilize this
            automation tool to better verify code changes within their Elixir projects. The presentations consisted of
            of a lecture, live audience exercises on GitHub, and close with time for questions.
        </p>

        <p>GitHub Actions enables you to build custom automations right within your GitHub repo. These
            automations can be used for Continuous Integration checks (verifying the app builds with no
            warnings,
            all the tests pass, etc), Continuous Deployment (package your app for release, execute the release,
            etc.), and many other creative workflows. The service is free for public repos and has a generous
            allocation for free-account private repos.
